It is basically woods, and every hole you step in is a slave. If you go through the woods for a while, you will come up to a tombstone about 3 feet tall. You can barely read it, but it is the tombstone of Watt,he was likely an important slave. Behind it is a rock lying on the ground, and underneath it is his wife. Next to it if you shine the light, you can see the sunken in ground where a slave is lying, and you can also see where the wife is laying. Its incredibly scary. You get a really weird feeling if you stand on in a grave in the pitch black.Make sure you bring flash lights. -  March 2004 Update/ additional info:Watt was the slave that ran from Brattonsville to retrieve Col. Bratton and inform him that a group of British loyalists were headed toward Brattonsville. Col. Bratton returned and defeated Capt. Huck's men, hence the Battle of Huck's Defeat.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.88", "moon_upper_transit": "09:38  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.1890359168241966", "city_latitude": "34.864825", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:44  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "SC", "sunrise": "06:13  DT", "median drinks per binge": "5.7", "binge drinking (%)": "16.3", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "82.7", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "70.8", "latitude_x": "34.864825", "resident_population_density": "", "usgs_region": "Southeast", "sun_upper_transit": "13:26  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "South Carolina", "taxpayer cost": "3983000000.0", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "moonset": "16:47  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "2586.0", "witness_count": "1", "state_abbrev": "SC", "longitude": "-81.176096", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "1.0", "sunset": "20:39  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-81.176096", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "54.5", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
