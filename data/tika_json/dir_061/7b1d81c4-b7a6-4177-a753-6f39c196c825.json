It has been (among other things), a part of the Underground Railroad, a psychiatric institution, an orphanage, and a morgue. The basement is where the most people have died, as it was where the most critical soldiers were taken, slaves hid, and then bodies were taken to the morgue in later years. The college has blocked off an old tunnel connecting the basement to the college chapel, due to 'student complaints', and the door to that section of the basement has been locked. Noises have been heard by most residents, along with footsteps. The doors also open occasionally, for no apparent reason.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.84", "moon_upper_transit": "14:59  ST", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_latitude": "41.3661614", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:30  ST", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Ohio", "state_abbrev": "OH", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "54.8", "latitude_x": "41.37111650000001", "resident_population_density": "", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:34  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "8520000000.0", "hp_day": "1860/06/30", "moonset": "22:15  ST", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "9", "latitude_y": "39.9612", "longitude": "-81.8478088", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "binge drinking (%)": "17.2", "sunset": "20:04  ST", "robbery": "", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-81.8543026", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "54.8", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
