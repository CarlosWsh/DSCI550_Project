This hotel was inflames in the 1920's, and it 'GLOWS' when the new moon is out. From the road, you can see every detail of that hotel. This hotel is surrounded by woods and across the street is also wooded. Its a three story hotel, all but abandoned, you can't get to the third floor anymore because of holes in the stairway. Third floor has reported to have cold hands applying pressure to their back. If you flash your light at a second floor window they flash back at you. In the basement, feelings of being threatened. The name \"Hotel Hell\" came from the blood on the walls and the yelling from the basement, the ring of the bell and the sound of wheels. The smell of sewer gas is still there in the bathrooms. Old books were in one of the rooms upstairs, burst into flames.- January 2004 update/correction - these caves are right below hotel hell. you will hear moaning as of creatures or monsters there. Witnesses have heard laughing, have seen a little girl in a black dress wearing no shoes on the stairs which go into the caves area. you can hear singing there day or night. near the old stables, visitors have been chased by white light which some of them have seen as a carriage drawn by white horses. also in the old stables the sounds of horses hooves have been heard. The submitter of the update has done some research into hotel hell and it may never have been owned by Al Capone. the first thing to be built there was a \"resort\" built in the 1800's which was one of those places where people went to be cleansed by the natural spring water which still runs pure and clear there today. when you walk the trails there (it's still open to the public) there is one cave door which has been partially opened due to a rockslide, spring water still runs there.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.19", "moon_upper_transit": "16:52  ST", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "1.890359168241966", "city_latitude": "44.276383", "begin_civil_twilight": "03:42  ST", "resident_population": "2632067.0", "state_y": "WI", "sun_upper_transit": "11:59  ST", "state_abbrev": "WI", "number_of_tribes": "10.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "24.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "12.8", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "43.0731", "latitude_x": "44.2862983", "resident_population_density": "48.6", "median binges monthly": "1.7", "usgs_region": "Midwest", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Wisconsin", "taxpayer cost": "4453000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "23:07  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "5", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "longitude": "-87.7738952", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "25.8", "sunset": "19:40  ST", "robbery": "", "hp_day": "1920/01/01", "city_longitude": "-87.8073129", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "63.2", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
