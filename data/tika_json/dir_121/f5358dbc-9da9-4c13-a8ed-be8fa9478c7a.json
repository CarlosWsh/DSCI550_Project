Some say it's the ghost of an unknown man whose head was severed in a train accident. He swings a lantern in a futile search for his missing part. Others say the \"light\" is the glow of the lantern swung by two lovers in their effort to stop the train late at night. Their parents forbid them to see each other, thus they planned this escape but were shot by her father who thought they were prowlers.
