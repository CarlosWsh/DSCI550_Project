At the base of the Mountain turn left and go up this road. About a 1/2 mile or so turn around. After you have turn around stop the car. Feel free to turn it off if you dare! Your car will start to roll and actually roll up the hill to the stop sign. Sometimes it will go beyond the stop sign but most of the time it will stop on the hill.\u00a0 Story has it that many years ago a mother was going to town to get some things. She had her three kids with her and the car stalled. She had to get up over the hill to get the car to run (Jump start I suppose) as she had the boys to get out and push it up the hill the oldest slipped and fell. As he did the other two couldn't keep the car going up the hill and the car backed back down and killed the all. Where they died is where the car stops on the hill.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.85", "moon_upper_transit": "09:28  DT", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.945179584120983", "state_abbrev": "NC", "city_latitude": "36.3665216", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:29  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "NC", "sunrise": "05:59  DT", "median drinks per binge": "5.4", "binge drinking (%)": "15.8", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "82.7", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "69.5", "latitude_x": "35.58301429999999", "under 21 death percentage": "3.08", "usgs_region": "Southeast", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "North Carolina", "taxpayer cost": "7034000000.0", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "moonset": "16:40  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "0", "location": "Gravity Hill", "longitude": "-80.2450923", "latitude_y": "35.7804", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "5.0", "sunset": "20:34  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-80.9284083", "quarter": "1", "chronic death percentage": "56.3", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
