Haunted on the top floor by two ghosts: Jessica, a chambermaid murdered by her lover, a stable hand, and the stable hand who committed suicide after killing her. Cold presences are felt going the stairs to the third floor, according to the staff. The Second floor is said to have been the location that \"Carl\" murdered his wife after finding out she had an affair with another man. (The AFSPR and RMPRS investigated and found numerous magnetic anomalies in the suggested room for the past homicide.) The third floor is said to hold the spirit of a mischievous little boy who died from the flu or some other type of illness. It is said he can be heard running up and down the hallway late at night. The AFSPR (American Foundation for Scientific Paranormal Research) will present a full report on this investigation sometime in August.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.89", "moon_upper_transit": "09:18  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:00  DT", "city_latitude": "39.6333213", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Colorado", "state_abbrev": "CO", "binge drinking (%)": "19.8", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "67.7", "latitude_x": "39.5794866", "under 21 death percentage": "2.78", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:02  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "5057000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:41  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "2623.0", "witness_count": "2", "latitude_y": "39.7392", "longitude": "-105.3819629", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:31  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-105.3172146", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "61.3", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
