In the mid-60s, the company secretary, who was engaged in a romantic affair with the owner apparently committed suicide in the front office. Actually, it was widely assumed that Mr. Vaughn killed the secretary who was also his sister in law because of a possible pregnancy. People who have worked late in the office have been known to hear a struggle between a man and a woman and then a silence. Persons living across the street from the block company in the house formerly owned by the secretary have reported the presence of a woman who could be described as looking like Mr. Vaughn's secretary. The spirit is not said to be evil, but very watchful, especially when the seasons change.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.04", "longitude_y": "-86.7816", "state_abbrev": "TN", "city_latitude": "36.25870520000001", "begin_civil_twilight": "03:59  ST", "resident_population": "2616556.0", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Tennessee", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "binge drinking (%)": "15.7", "resident_population_density_rank": "18.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.8", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "11.9", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "36.1627", "latitude_x": "36.253143", "under 21 death percentage": "2.95", "median binges monthly": "1.7", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "11:49  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "4684000000.0", "hp_day": "1930/06/01", "moonset": "14:05  ST", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "2", "location": "Morristown Block", "longitude": "-83.207672", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "19:07  ST", "robbery": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_longitude": "-83.19516759999999", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "55.3", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
