Many, many years ago, long before the school was ever built, the grounds were a holding house for prisoners. Many of the prisoners were mistreated and murdered by the guards. Their bodies were buried on the plot, unmarked, and later the school was built over their graves. Many times late at night you can see them walking the grounds. They are very restless and some quite hostile. One summer, after the night of a full moon, the following morning all the birds and squirrels in the surrounding trees were found mysteriously dead all over the school grounds.
