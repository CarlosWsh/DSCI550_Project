The boiler exploded and killed the kids. Now if you go late at night then u can hear screams, sometimes you will see little kids, if you take pictures and get them developed you will see orbs and strange smoke that is in the shape of people. But when u look at the spots in person there is nothing, but in the pictures there is freaky stuff. On the walls in the boiler room there are child size handprints burned into the wall. -  November 2005 update: no screams where noted. A well-defined shadow of a little kid was seen through one of the glass doors in the school. The investigators watched this figure move from side to side of the door and then it walked toward them through the door and stood still for around 30 seconds, all of the sudden it bent down and got into like a 3 point lineman stance and then jumped toward them, they turned the lights on and there was nothing there. They placed a voice recorder in the boiler room as well and got what sounded to be a heartbeat that kept getting faster and louder and then made one loud beat and stopped. Also there was a loud moaning throughout the whole schoolhouse from the pipes but there is no heat going through the pipes so I have no clue why that would be making noise. An update to make on the school is that it was demolished last year and made into a park for the community.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.85", "moon_upper_transit": "09:28  DT", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.945179584120983", "city_latitude": "35.3265409", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:29  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "NC", "state_x": "North Carolina", "state_abbrev": "NC", "binge drinking (%)": "15.8", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "82.7", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "69.5", "latitude_x": "35.3551368", "under 21 death percentage": "3.08", "usgs_region": "Southeast", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "7034000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:40  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "16", "location": "Elementary School", "longitude": "-83.195284", "latitude_y": "35.7804", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "5.0", "sunset": "20:34  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-83.12200740000002", "quarter": "1", "chronic death percentage": "56.3", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
