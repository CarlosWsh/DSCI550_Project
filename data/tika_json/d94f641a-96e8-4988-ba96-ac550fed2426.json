He built a mill and was a wealthy man. He had several wives and several children, but most of them died mysteriously. Mr. Slagle is said to have murdered them all, but since there was no law in Livingston County yet, he was never officially charged. He was also responsible for the first reported murder in Livingston County. The body of the man he murdered is buried beneath the road that runs past the cemetery. The graves of his wives and children are still there along with his own, and the cemetery is said to be haunted. There is also a very old bridge on the property which is said to be haunted. One of the wives supposedly hung herself from the bridge after the mysterious death of one of her children. There are satanic symbols painted on the bridge, and it is very spooky. There have been several people who have been mysteriously pushed off the bridge and injured when no one was standing around. It used to be a place where teenagers hung out at night, but too many people have been injured and it is now off limits. The current owners of the property have reported hearing mysterious whispers on the bridge and sightings of Mr. Slagle are very common around the cemetery and where the mill stood. The submitter claims to have a picture that they took of the cemetery on a clear night, but on the picture it looks like it is snowing. There are dozens of small orbs and also the transparent figure of a young woman in an old fashioned dress. -  December update: The bridge was torn down", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.47", "longitude_y": "-92.1735", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:13  DT", "city_latitude": "39.7952946", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Missouri", "state_abbrev": "MO", "binge drinking (%)": "18.9", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "80.2", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "70.5", "latitude_x": "", "under 21 death percentage": "3.72", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:11  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "4604000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:44  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "", "location": "Slagle Cemetery/Bridge", "longitude": "", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:37  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-93.5524358", "personal theft/larceny": "", "chronic death percentage": "52.5", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
