If one sits on the bridge with their car turned off on the nights of April 12-14, the bridge becomes covered with fog and the couple can be heard arguing. After a period of silence, a loud splash can be heard. On several occasions, the wife has walked up to the car. And on several occasions, people driving across the bridge on said nights have had their cars to stop, turn off, and all electrical systems stop. They then HAVE to bear witness to the events of the night. - December 2003 update: The Bridge is in Demorest on Hwy 115/Cannon Bridge road. A new Bridge has been built and opened on 10/30/03. They have started to tear down the old bridge the same day. About 1/4 of the bridge that was build in 1950 is gone.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.86", "longitude_y": "-84.388", "aggravated assault": "86.0", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "8186453.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:58  DT", "city_latitude": "34.6125971", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Georgia", "median drinks per binge": "5.3", "binge drinking (%)": "15.1", "resident_population_density_rank": "20.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.6", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "26.4", "simple assault": "324.0", "male death percentage": "69.3", "latitude_x": "34.6125971", "under 21 death percentage": "3.67", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:39  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "6931000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "13:41  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "3953.0", "witness_count": "4", "state_abbrev": "GA", "longitude": "-83.5248933", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:51  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "hp_day": "2003/12/20", "city_longitude": "-83.5248933", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "55.3", "rape/sexual assault": "21.0", "robbery": "54.0"}
