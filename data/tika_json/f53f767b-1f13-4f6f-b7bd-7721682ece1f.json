The grounds keeper called Indian Joe would not let them, so they ran him over and built the road over him. If you drive down the road which is up hill both ways and stop at the bottom, put your car in neutral Joe will push you up hill to the end of the road. If you put flour or any powder on the back of your car you will see the handprints after the push. - February 2004 Update: If traveling South on WI 55 its a quarter mile from a hotel on the right and it will be your first right on a road after Co Tk F. The submitter tried it and it is a real \"Gravity Hill.\" They report no handprints on the back of their truck though. Thinking it was a fluke they turned around and tried to roll down the hill from midway up and i went happily rolling backwards up the hill into 30 mph headwind! The road isn\u2019t all to tricky to find but coming from Lakeshore Drive and 55 the road ID signs have been removed, by either locals trying to keep people from trying the hill or by vandals.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.19", "longitude_y": "-89.4012", "aggravated assault": "", "city_latitude": "44.07165579999999", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:43  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "WI", "sun_upper_transit": "13:00  DT", "state_abbrev": "WI", "binge drinking (%)": "25.8", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "43.0731", "latitude_x": "44.02803660000001", "under 21 death percentage": "2.3", "median binges monthly": "1.7", "usgs_region": "Midwest", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Wisconsin", "taxpayer cost": "4453000000.0", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "moonset": "16:44  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "3", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "longitude": "-88.3065288", "time_of_day": "Morning", "number_of_tribes": "10.0", "sunset": "20:41  DT", "robbery": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "1.890359168241966", "city_longitude": "-88.2989947", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "63.2", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
