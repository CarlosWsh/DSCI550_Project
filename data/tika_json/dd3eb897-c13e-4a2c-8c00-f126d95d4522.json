This mysterious vagabond would endlessly walk a 365-mile loop between the Connecticut and Hudson rivers. He did this 360 times between 1858 and 1889, stopping to rest in caves along the way. Local people donated extra food to him whenever he was in their town. His body was found in the Saw Mill Woods cave in Sing Sing, NY in 1889. He supposedly haunts the caves that he used to occupy. This particular cave is the most popular. It is located on the Mattituck Trail, approx. 2 miles southeast of Black Rock State Park on Rt. 6 in Watertown.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.75", "moon_upper_transit": "20:27  ST", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.5671077504725899", "city_latitude": "41.6062042", "begin_civil_twilight": "03:41  ST", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "CT", "state_x": "Connecticut", "state_abbrev": "CT", "binge drinking (%)": "18.7", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "84.9", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "68.2", "latitude_x": "41.6395124", "resident_population_density": "", "usgs_region": "Northwest", "curphase": "Waxing Gibbous", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "3029000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "00:51  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "3", "latitude_y": "41.764", "longitude": "-73.08796099999999", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "3.0", "sunset": "19:29  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "hp_day": "1858/07/05", "city_longitude": "-73.11833969999999", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "55.2", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
