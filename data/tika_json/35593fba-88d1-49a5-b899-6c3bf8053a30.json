If you stop the car or get out you are not able to see him. But if you drive slow enough he will wave at you and sometimes get out of the tree and run up to the fence. We have never seen him past the fence. Legend has it that the ghost of a little girl haunts a tree in the cemetery. This tree is close to her grave and is a perfect climbing tree. The little girl reportedly sits in the tree and waves to passers-by. The little girl was an avid tree-climber and loved to play with the neighborhood kids before her death. Most accounts list her cause of death a drowning. Many people speculate that since she was so open and friendly in life, and her death was such a lonely one, she feels lonely and tries to make friends of the people who drive past on their way to or from the hills surrounding the town.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.19", "longitude_y": "-116.1997", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.7561436672967864", "state_abbrev": "ID", "city_latitude": "43.49165139999999", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:28  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "ID", "state_x": "Idaho", "median drinks per binge": "5.8", "number_of_tribes": "4.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "85.9", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "68.6", "latitude_x": "43.4660167", "under 21 death percentage": "3.01", "median binges monthly": "2.0", "usgs_region": "Northwest", "sun_upper_transit": "13:47  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "1138000000.0", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "moonset": "17:39  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "1", "location": "Ammon Cemetery", "longitude": "-111.9307333", "latitude_y": "43.6178", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "binge drinking (%)": "16.0", "sunset": "21:30  DT", "robbery": "", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-112.0339645", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "60.8", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
