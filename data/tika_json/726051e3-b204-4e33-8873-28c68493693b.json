They once went off in a storm and a face seemed to appear in the mirror. Often, in different parts of the theatre, loud screaming noises can be heard, even though nobody is around. The area around the building always seems to be windy. Also In the prop room in Maddox theatre, there is a bell that supposedly rings on it's own. It was taken years earlier for a girl that was ill in her room and anytime she needed anything, she was to ring the bell. A couple of days later, she died in a car accident. It is said that a man several years later had the bell for the same purpose, and he would wake up in the middle of the night to the sound of the bell ringing.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.51", "moon_upper_transit": "09:14  DT", "state_abbrev": "IL", "city_latitude": "42.2711311", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:58  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Illinois", "median drinks per binge": "5.7", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "82.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "39.798", "latitude_x": "42.26889329999999", "resident_population_density": "", "usgs_region": "", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "4:58 am", "taxpayer cost": "9716000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:36  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "5151.0", "witness_count": "4", "location": "Rockford College", "longitude": "-89.01874480000001", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "20.5", "sunset": "20:30  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_longitude": "-89.0939952", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "57.4", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
