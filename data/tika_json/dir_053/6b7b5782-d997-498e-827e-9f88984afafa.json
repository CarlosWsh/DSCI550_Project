The ghost of a sea captain named Thomas Moristo who lived there in the 1700s is believed to still reside there. When the home is vacant, a man has been seen peering through the windows. Many people who have lived there have reported that they will turn on the stove, go upstairs, then come down and find the stove turned off. On one incidence, a resident was painting the house and left the paint inside the front foyer. The next morning he found all the paint had been moved outside. - The house was once in a bad fire, and it is believed the ghost does these things attempting to prevent another fire. Many people have become too frightened and refused to live in this house, and some residences have claimed to see apparitions of the old man while inside the house.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.46", "longitude_y": "-84.2807", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.5671077504725899", "city_latitude": "30.42130899999999", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:07  ST", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "FL", "sunrise": "05:35  ST", "state_abbrev": "FL", "number_of_tribes": "3.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "85.9", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "30.4383", "latitude_x": "30.41104139999999", "under 21 death percentage": "2.34", "usgs_region": "Southeast", "quarter": "2", "city_sunrise": "4:54 am", "state_x": "Florida", "taxpayer cost": "15322000000.0", "hp_day": "1700/06/01", "moonset": "23:42  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "4", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "longitude": "-87.2093412", "time_of_day": "Morning", "binge drinking (%)": "17.5", "sunset": "19:42  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-87.2169149", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "60.8", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
