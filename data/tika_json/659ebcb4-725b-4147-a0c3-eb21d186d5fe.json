This occurred during WWI when tensions were high against German-Americans. The church was rebuilt on the original basement. Ironically, it is now used as a haunted house during October. Workers and patrons alike have experienced cold spots, uneasiness, footsteps, shadow figures, and images of both a hell hound and a hooded figure walking around. After some investigation it was found that seven spirits inhabit the building, and one referred to as the demon. This demon is responsible for hiding objects and grabbing people to the point of leaving bruises. -  April 2004 Update:The Old First Baptist Church in Collinsville, Illlinois, burned to the ground overnight just before Halloween this past October, 2003.
