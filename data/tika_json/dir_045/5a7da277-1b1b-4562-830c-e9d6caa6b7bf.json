Often, young lieutenants will wake up to a bed soaked through with water. They\u2019ll see shadows move down the hallway, (mostly on the second floor) and also many report having vivid and horrifying nightmares. Some will continue to scream even if prompted to wake up. A burnt electrical smell also pervades the 2nd floor on occasion, as well as haywire electrical appliances. The spirits are attributed to Confederate soldiers who drowned in the Alabama River while trying to cross into the city of Montgomery. The ghosts also show a predilection for students who are from northern or western states (states which are not known for their southern accent).", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.06", "moon_upper_transit": "10:16  ST", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.945179584120983", "city_latitude": "32.3668052", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:10  ST", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "AL", "sunrise": "04:38  ST", "state_abbrev": "AL", "number_of_tribes": "5.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "79.9", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "11:47  ST", "latitude_x": "32.3791188", "under 21 death percentage": "3.94", "median binges monthly": "1.7", "usgs_region": "Southeast", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "city_sunrise": "4:50 am", "state_x": "Alabama", "taxpayer cost": "3724000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "17:22  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "7", "location": "Maxwell Air Force Base", "longitude": "-86.3625598", "latitude_y": "32.377", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "binge drinking (%)": "13.6", "sunset": "18:55  ST", "robbery": "", "hp_day": "1865/07/16", "city_longitude": "-86.2999689", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "49.8", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
