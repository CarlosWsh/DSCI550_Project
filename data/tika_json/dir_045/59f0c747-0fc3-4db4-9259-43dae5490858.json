Trespassing is a crime. You could get arrested or worse, hurt. Be smart, courtious, and be legal.- At the intersection of Marina Village Pkwy and Mariner Square Dr, turn left and go straight. Take the first right into an industrial parking lot and you'll see the asylum straight ahead. Patients used to be tortured and killed there, and it's abandoned now. At nighttime, stand out in the front and look at the fifth window from the right on the second story. The blinds open and close themselves. Sometimes when you walk inside, you'll hear a loud scream the second you enter the door. Also, you get the chills and have the feeling that someone's behind you. When you're inside, you will hear screaming coming from a distant room in the house. Down in the basement there are ropes that people used to hang themselves with. Even during the day, if you take pictures occasionally there will be orbs or even a glowing, ghostly figure in the picture.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.29", "moon_upper_transit": "18:46  DT", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "16.824196597353495", "resident_population": "33871648.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:10  DT", "city_latitude": "37.7652065", "state_y": "CA", "state_x": "California", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "binge drinking (%)": "16.6", "resident_population_density_rank": "14.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "13.8", "simple assault": "257.0", "male death percentage": "69.1", "latitude_x": "37.7627824", "under 21 death percentage": "2.49", "usgs_region": "Pacific", "sun_upper_transit": "13:08  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "35011000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "00:32  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "4", "state_abbrev": "CA", "longitude": "-122.253901", "latitude_y": "38.575764", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "89.0", "sunset": "20:34  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "hp_day": "2007/10/02", "city_longitude": "-122.2416355", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "64.4", "rape/sexual assault": "18.0", "robbery": "41.0"}
