The story is that he favored entertaining local children and the parents accused him of being a pedophile. Although that was never proven, they got together and burned his house down. It is said that not only was he innocent, but that several children were present when the parents set fire to the house and that they were killed in the resulting blaze, along with Weary. The house no longer exists, but out of tradition visitors park by the space in the trees where his driveway supposedly was. They report to have seen phantom cars & a phantom motorcycle that followed them to a right-hand turn and then disappeared.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.19", "year": "1999", "moon_upper_transit": "20:00  DT", "aggravated assault": "119.0", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "1.890359168241966", "city_latitude": "42.91694620000001", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:43  DT", "longitude_x": "", "state_y": "WI", "state_x": "Wisconsin", "state_abbrev": "WI", "binge drinking (%)": "25.8", "resident_population_density_rank": "26.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "4.0", "simple assault": "365.0", "latitude_y": "43.0731", "latitude_x": "", "resident_population_density": "90.3", "median binges monthly": "1.7", "usgs_region": "Midwest", "sun_upper_transit": "12:59  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "4453000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "01:33  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "7", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "longitude": "", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "10.0", "sunset": "20:40  DT", "robbery": "72.0", "hp_day": "1999/12/31", "city_longitude": "-89.21789369999999", "curphase": "Waxing Gibbous", "chronic death percentage": "63.2", "rape/sexual assault": "40.0"}
