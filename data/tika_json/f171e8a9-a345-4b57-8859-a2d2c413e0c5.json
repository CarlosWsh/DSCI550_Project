A worker fell to her death from the hotel's upper floors in the 1960's, possibly adding to the ghostly air of the place. Visitors have experienced a levitating paperweight, which crashed back to the glass-covered top of the desk. The staff has become painfully aware of the manifestations, and most have started to notice them. Complaints about the noise are common among hotel guests, but, as one former employee put it, \"How do you turn off a ghost?\". When staff members investigate the disturbances, which seem to come largely from the 9th floor, the noise abruptly stops, only to start up again later.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.01", "longitude_y": "-122.9007", "city_latitude": "47.6062095", "begin_civil_twilight": "03:36  ST", "resident_population": "1356621.0", "state_y": "WA", "sunrise": "04:16  ST", "state_abbrev": "WA", "binge drinking (%)": "15.4", "resident_population_density_rank": "37.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "87.2", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "18.8", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "66.0", "latitude_x": "47.613312", "resident_population_density": "20.4", "usgs_region": "Northwest", "sun_upper_transit": "12:13  ST", "city_sunrise": "5:06 am", "state_x": "Washington", "taxpayer cost": "5805000000.0", "hp_day": "1920/12/31", "moonset": "23:24  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "4", "latitude_y": "47.0379", "longitude": "-122.340053", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "30.0", "sunset": "20:10  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.5", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "5.671077504725898", "city_longitude": "-122.3320708", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "64.6", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
