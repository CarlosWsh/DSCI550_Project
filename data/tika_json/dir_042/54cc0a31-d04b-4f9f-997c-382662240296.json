The No. 7 train bound from Macon to Atlanta stopped to pick up passengers at the McDonough Station on a night during a flood. Even after being warned not to leave the engineer was reported saying \"We will either be eating breakfast in Atlanta or in hell\". After traveling only seven miles from the station the train plunged into the swelled waters of Camp Creek after the train trestle had washed out minutes before. Nine out of the forty-seven on board survived. You can reach the trestle if you go north on Highway 42 out of McDonough (located 30 miles south of Atlanta) and turn left onto Ivey Edwards Rd. The trestle is right off the tracks to the left and can be seen from Highway 42.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.86", "longitude_y": "-84.388", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_latitude": "33.4473361", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:58  ST", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Georgia", "state_abbrev": "GA", "binge drinking (%)": "15.1", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.6", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "69.3", "latitude_x": "", "under 21 death percentage": "3.67", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:39  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "6931000000.0", "hp_day": "1900/01/01", "moonset": "14:34  ST", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "9", "location": "Camp Creek Trestle", "longitude": "", "time_of_day": "Morning", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "19:51  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-84.1468616", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "55.3", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
