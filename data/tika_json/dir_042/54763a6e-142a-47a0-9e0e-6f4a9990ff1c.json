The rumor is that before it was a restaurant that it was a house back in the 40's and a couple in their mid 20's lived there and then the man go drafted to WWII and he never returned. The house was torn down in the mid 70's after it had been vacant for years after the woman died and made into a place of business at times you can see the lady sitting looking out the window waiting for her husband to return from war there has been times that 40's style swing music has been heard over the jukebox and no disc is playing and she has been seen moving around the building in a night gown and sometimes she will move dishes. - March 2007 Correction: The facts about the Pizza Hut are not accurate. It was the home of a TheShadowlands.net/ghosts visitor\u2019s mother-in-law. She states the woman and her husband divorced and he moved to California. If it is her ghost, she would be waiting for her sons to come home, not a husband. The house was not vacant for any great length of time; at the most about a year. The visitor states she spent quite a few week ends in the house; was never afraid. One night something patted her and she thought it was her husband, however it was not. She and her husband figured it could have been the ghost of his younger brother who had died in the house. From what she had been told, he was a great kid and worried about the wildness of his older brother. He was only fifteen when cancer ended his life. Her husband's grand mother lived in the house prior to her death and she did like to re-arrange things. However, since this family loved the Lord, our visitor thinks no one at the Pizza Hut has anything to fear.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.36", "longitude_y": "-97.5164", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "16.257088846880908", "city_latitude": "36.6678426", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:45  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "OK", "state_x": "Oklahoma", "median drinks per binge": "5.6", "number_of_tribes": "86.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "85.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "68.6", "latitude_x": "36.663124", "under 21 death percentage": "2.76", "median binges monthly": "1.5", "usgs_region": "Southwest", "sun_upper_transit": "13:32  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "3081000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:59  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "5", "state_abbrev": "OK", "longitude": "-96.334328", "latitude_y": "35.4676", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "13.6", "sunset": "20:49  DT", "robbery": "", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-96.3372309", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "58.7", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
