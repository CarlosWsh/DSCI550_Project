The couple decided to take in some of sites at the falls area before going back to their room at the lodge. Before leaving the falls they wanted to have their photos the with the falls in the background. The couple found an overlook just a few hundred feet from the falls that would work great for the photo. As the Bride stood on the Pillars at the edge of the 75 to 80 foot cliff, the Bride lost her balance and fell to her death. This place is now called \"Lovers Leap\".
