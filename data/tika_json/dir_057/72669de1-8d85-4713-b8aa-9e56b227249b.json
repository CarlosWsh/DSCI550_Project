She died of malaria on August 12, 1838, and on the anniversary of her death he ghost is said to walk the towpath of this lock. Jack's Lock is haunted by the charred phantom of a lock keeper who was struck by lighting while patrolling the canal. A ghastly ghost walks the ruins of Spruceville, a deserted settlement within the park. Esther Hale was to be married in August, 1837, but her lover never showed up. Her badly decomposed body was found in her cabin four months later, still dressed in her wedding gown. Ever since, her white skeleton, wearing a dirty wedding gown, is seen darting in front of cars or jumping out to touch the living.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.84", "moon_upper_transit": "12:12  ST", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_latitude": "40.6186756", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:30  ST", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:33  ST", "state_abbrev": "OH", "binge drinking (%)": "17.2", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "54.8", "latitude_x": "40.726653", "resident_population_density": "", "usgs_region": "", "curphase": "New Moon", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Ohio", "taxpayer cost": "8520000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "20:17  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "3", "location": "Beaver Creek State Park", "longitude": "-80.613689", "latitude_y": "39.9612", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:04  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "hp_day": "1838/08/12", "city_longitude": "-80.5772928", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "54.8", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
