The door on the costume room does not lock and there is no ladies restroom in the green room, because there is no green room. What can be heard is noises of something moving on the catwalk above the stage and the lights around the stage will come on and go off with out anyone working them. As a former Drama student and graduate of Evan's, as well as many of the students have experienced the guy from the gym in the auditorium. He has never tried to harm anyone or scare anyone at all. It is believed he just wanders around the school and doesn't want to leave, you can feel him in different parts of the school.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.46", "location": "Evans High School", "longitude_y": "-84.2807", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.5671077504725899", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "06:08  DT", "city_latitude": "28.5383355", "state_y": "FL", "state_x": "Florida", "state_abbrev": "FL", "binge drinking (%)": "17.5", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "85.9", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "69.2", "latitude_x": "28.579318", "under 21 death percentage": "2.34", "usgs_region": "Southeast", "sun_upper_transit": "13:39  DT", "city_sunrise": "5:31 am", "taxpayer cost": "15322000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:53  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "10655.0", "witness_count": "4", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "longitude": "-81.4485844", "latitude_y": "30.4383", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "3.0", "sunset": "20:42  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-81.3792365", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "60.8", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
