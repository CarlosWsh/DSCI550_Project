The most pronounced story is that of the Jesus Tree (cut down in the early 1990's). This tree with the image of Jesus on the crucifix was said to \"bleed\" a red substance from its trunk when they cut it down. There are twelve trees evenly spaced and equal in stature directly following where the Jesus Tree stood. These are said to be the twelve apostles. When you travel farther down the road (eastbound), you come to a very curious looking estate. this ominous looking estate is actually Morefar Golf Club. This is believed to be a cover for something else. Word of links to the Satanic church have been bantered about. The main entrance has a sign reading \"Back 'o Beyond\". Interesting welcome for a country club. Immediately following Morefar, and across the street is Farrington Pond. There have been several stories about people driving off the road, into the pond, claiming to have seen \"something\". The undifinitive story of this pond is that a young lady, on her way to a High School Prom, went off the road and into the pond. She was said to have drowned. When the moonlight hits the water, people have been known to see an image in a prom dress on top of the water, dancing - alone. In 1988, a young man named Dean, was found in his car on the side of the pond (just off the road), dead from gun shot wounds to the back of his head. The two men who were responsible were captured within a week. It is unknown whether this has anything to do with the spirit of the pond, but, if nothing else, it adds to the eeriness of the road.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.08", "year": "1988", "moon_upper_transit": "18:36  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "1.1342155009451798", "state_abbrev": "NY", "resident_population": "17558072.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:42  DT", "city_latitude": "41.3973163", "state_y": "NY", "state_x": "New York", "median drinks per binge": "5.4", "number_of_tribes": "6.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "8.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.4", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "-3.7", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:57  DT", "latitude_x": "41.4070252", "under 21 death percentage": "2.03", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "usgs_region": "Northwest", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "16330000000.0", "hp_day": "1988/03/17", "moonset": "00:26  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "7", "latitude_y": "42.6526", "longitude": "-73.55148080000001", "time_of_day": "Morning", "binge drinking (%)": "17.6", "sunset": "20:36  DT", "robbery": "", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-73.6170721", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "63.3", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
