You can hear beating of drums, crying, screaming, footsteps and you can see a boy run across the soccer field late at night. *This actually is the Brafferton Building, a building used to house Indians after the massacre of the colonists in the 1700's. The 10 year old Indian boys were taken from their families, and forced to become like all the other colonists. When the Indians started to run away, they were locked in at night. One boy lowered a rope from his window, leaving the school every night to run across the greens like he had as a child. He was found dead of unknown causes under his window.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.78", "longitude_y": "-77.436", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.5671077504725899", "state_abbrev": "VA", "city_latitude": "37.2707022", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:18  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "VA", "sunrise": "05:49  DT", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "number_of_tribes": "3.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:12  DT", "latitude_x": "37.271674", "resident_population_density": "", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "usgs_region": "Northwest", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Virginia", "taxpayer cost": "6126000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:39  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "10", "location": "William and Mary", "longitude": "-76.71337799999999", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "16.4", "sunset": "20:34  DT", "robbery": "", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-76.7074571", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "57.1", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
