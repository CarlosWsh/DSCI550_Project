On several occasions, this pillar is scheduled to be removed for development, but on each occasion the person who was supposed to remove it died unexpectedly. A few years ago a driver lost control of his car and bumped into the pillar. He was dead in his car when the police arrived, but the accident was not life threatening. It is said that a slave put a curse on the pillar to which he was tied as he was being sold. For whatever reason, the pillar still stands alone with nothing else around it on the corner of Broad Street.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.86", "longitude_y": "-84.388", "city_latitude": "33.4734978", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:58  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Georgia", "state_abbrev": "GA", "binge drinking (%)": "15.1", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.6", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "69.3", "latitude_x": "33.4726131", "under 21 death percentage": "3.67", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:39  DT", "city_sunrise": "4:39 am", "taxpayer cost": "6931000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "17:00  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "3953.0", "witness_count": "1", "location": "The Pillar", "longitude": "-81.9588606", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:51  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_longitude": "-82.0105148", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "55.3", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
