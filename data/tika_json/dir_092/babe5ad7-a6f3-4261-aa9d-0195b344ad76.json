Buckhout road evidently dates way back to the early days of the country, 1600's. the local magistrate or some such, (an influential person in the area nonetheless) by the name of Isaac Buckhout suspected that his wife was cheating on him with a friend of his. He invited the friend and his son over to dinner one night where he proceeded to take a shotgun and kill the two of them as well as his wife. Afterward he walked a good 12-15 miles to Tarrytown and sat in a pub until the police picked him up a few hours later. The jury that tried him deliberated for days over his sentence but as the story goes he was the last man hung in White Plains, NY. Now apparently off the main road there are several side roads wherein if you walk into the woods you will see houses that have been abandoned. Further legend has it that back in the 1600's three women were burned at the stake supposedly for witchcraft where the road now lies. There have been reports of their spirits supposedly roaming the area around the road and rumors tell a story of three X's being painted on the road to mark the spot where the woman died. As legend goes, if you drive over these X's and stop, your car will stall and \"strange things will happen.\" Exactly what is not known. Additionally there is also an old Zionist cemetery in the area which is supposedly comprised mostly of slaves who died during the 1600's. - September 2004 update: There is no trespassing in this area. be warned.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.08", "moon_upper_transit": "09:08  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "state_abbrev": "NY", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:42  DT", "city_latitude": "41.1220194", "state_y": "NY", "state_x": "New York", "median drinks per binge": "5.4", "number_of_tribes": "2.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.4", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:57  DT", "latitude_x": "41.055523", "under 21 death percentage": "2.03", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "usgs_region": "Northeast", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "16330000000.0", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "moonset": "16:37  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "3", "latitude_y": "42.6526", "longitude": "-73.748719", "time_of_day": "Morning", "binge drinking (%)": "17.6", "sunset": "20:37  DT", "robbery": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.3780718336483932", "city_longitude": "-73.7948516", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "63.3", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
