While guests of the Inn may enjoy modern amenities such as an outdoor Olympic sized pool and fitness center, the catacombs that run underneath the building heading in the direction of Mt. Rubidoux are now closed. As one current employee of the Inn remembers, an older gentleman was once given a room in one of the upper stories of the building, as there were no lower floor rooms available due to construction. The next morning, when the gentleman was asked if his accommodations were adequate, he replied, \"All was fine, especially the woman singing beautifully in the next room.\" He was the only tenant on that floor. This place is haunted by the Millers. The Mission Inn Hotel was originally a 12 room cottage where the pool now sits. The existing structure of the hotel was begun in 1900 and completed in a pproximately 1947. Owned first by C.C. Miller and sold to his son, Frank, in 1900. Frank's sister, Alice, managed the hotel until her death in the late '40s.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.29", "moon_upper_transit": "07:19  ST", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "16.824196597353495", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:10  ST", "city_latitude": "33.9533487", "state_y": "CA", "state_x": "California", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "binge drinking (%)": "16.6", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:07  ST", "latitude_x": "33.9841225", "under 21 death percentage": "2.49", "usgs_region": "Pacific", "quarter": "2", "city_sunrise": "4:54 am", "taxpayer cost": "35011000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "14:16  ST", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "1", "state_abbrev": "CA", "longitude": "-117.3763701", "time_of_day": "Morning", "number_of_tribes": "89.0", "sunset": "19:33  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "hp_day": "1900/06/30", "city_longitude": "-117.3961564", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "64.4", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
