Quite a few years ago, while cleaning out some old storage rooms, an urn was found with the ashes of a Charles Valentine. Some inquiries were made and it was found that Charles was a Mason. No one knows why the ashes were not buried at the time of his death, but they were eventually returned to be buried correctly. Since that time strange things happen in this lovely old building. Doors open when they are closed and locked. Lights turn on when they are off and visa versa. You can hear doors slam when no one else is in the building. These stories have come from many of the caretakers that have worked there. One even reported seeing a young girl floating down a hallway and some little child's footprints in ashtray sand.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.7", "moon_upper_transit": "21:16  ST", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "449396.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:23  ST", "city_latitude": "40.7607793", "state_y": "", "sunrise": "04:56  ST", "state_abbrev": "UT", "binge drinking (%)": "10.5", "resident_population_density_rank": "45.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "79.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "20.4", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:29  ST", "latitude_x": "40.7689137", "resident_population_density": "5.5", "usgs_region": "", "curphase": "Waxing Gibbous", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Utah", "taxpayer cost": "1636000000.0", "hp_day": "1926/07/26", "moonset": "02:13  ST", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "4", "median drinks per binge": "5.6", "longitude": "-111.8724156", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:02  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.7", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-111.8910474", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "47.8", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
