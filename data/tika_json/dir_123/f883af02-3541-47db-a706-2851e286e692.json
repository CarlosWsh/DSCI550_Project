There have been sightings by one of the janiors that used to work in the school. She cleaned the auditorium routinely and often found one of the side doors locked, when it wasn't supposed to be. When she returned with the key, the door was shut and locked. One time she felt something like a person pass through here, and very soon after quit her job because of how much it frightened her. There have been rumors by teachers that there is one 'bad' ghost and one 'good' ghost, the bad one in the auditorium.
