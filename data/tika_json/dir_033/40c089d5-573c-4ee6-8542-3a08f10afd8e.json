It is said to be the ghost of the gentleman the hall is named after.March 2007 Additional information: Every Year, Moravian College celebrates Halloween with haunted houses and parties. One year, a haunted tour was given, with real and fake stories told along the route. As the tour was given, a friend was instructed to go ahead and turn off the basement lights for a walk through Comenius Hall. This was to give a more spooky affect. Three times he tried the lights and all three times, he watched the switch turn back on. After that, he abandoned the task and went back to the group. As the group descended to walk through the basement, one of the members of the group hesitated. He was blind and his guide dog was leading him. According to the man, the dog was signaling danger and trying to stop him from venturing into the basement. There was no visible danger, yet the dog was very reluctant and tried diligently to stop them from going to the basement. After the tour, the man explained that his dog never did that before and was unsure what such a reaction was caused by. No one on the tour noticed anything suspicious in the basement.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.59", "moon_upper_transit": "09:21  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:05  DT", "city_latitude": "40.6259316", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Pennsylvania", "state_abbrev": "PA", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.7", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:09  DT", "latitude_x": "40.6308814", "resident_population_density": "", "usgs_region": "", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "9544000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:44  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "1", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "longitude": "-75.3812135", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "18.5", "sunset": "20:41  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-75.37045789999999", "personal theft/larceny": "", "chronic death percentage": "52.4", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
