Miners often say the rock fall was caused by a man with a load of dynamite seeking revenge with a person in the mine. After the event was over the mine was shut down for about a year. After that they figured it wouldn't happen again. Miners claim to have seen figures in windows looking out at them. They describe the figure as a middle-aged man with a trucker hat. His skin is a dark gray. In some cases miners have heard a screeching sound and then seeing flashes of gray and black and a high-pitched scream. Also, miners claim to have been hit hard across the head with a hard rock. BUT it is a good idea to go to the mine. ?", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.19", "moon_upper_transit": "16:22  ST", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.7561436672967864", "city_latitude": "47.4740945", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:27  ST", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "ID", "sunrise": "05:03  ST", "median drinks per binge": "5.8", "number_of_tribes": "4.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "85.9", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "43.6178", "latitude_x": "47.471669", "under 21 death percentage": "3.01", "median binges monthly": "2.0", "usgs_region": "Northwest", "sun_upper_transit": "12:46  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Idaho", "taxpayer cost": "1138000000.0", "hp_day": "1890/01/01", "moonset": "23:46  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "78", "state_abbrev": "ID", "longitude": "-115.925534", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "16.0", "sunset": "20:30  ST", "robbery": "", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-115.9279386", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "60.8", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
