The former brig, which is the only original building remaining on what is now a state park and camping area, has been the scene of several apparitions, all described in detail by at least half a dozen state employees. These employees worked in the brig building, which was for many years used as a state parks maintenance building. All of the employees who encountered a ghostly visitor talked about a balding man who might have been in some kind of uniform - possibly prisoner's garb. Others, who did not see the apparition, talked about hair-raising experiences with large objects being mysteriously \"relocated\" or objects flying across the cells - which still exist in the building, bars and all.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.19", "longitude_y": "-116.1997", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.7561436672967864", "resident_population": "524873.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:27  ST", "city_latitude": "47.9479601", "state_y": "ID", "state_x": "Idaho", "median drinks per binge": "5.8", "number_of_tribes": "4.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "46.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "85.9", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "17.9", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "68.6", "latitude_x": "47.951532", "resident_population_density": "6.4", "usgs_region": "Northwest", "sun_upper_transit": "12:46  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "1138000000.0", "hp_day": "1942/06/01", "moonset": "00:40  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "6", "state_abbrev": "ID", "longitude": "-116.602778", "latitude_y": "43.6178", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "binge drinking (%)": "16.0", "sunset": "20:30  ST", "median binges monthly": "2.0", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-116.7079745", "quarter": "2", "chronic death percentage": "60.8", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
