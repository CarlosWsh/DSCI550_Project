Trahlyta was a young woman that sought out The Witch of Cedar Mountain to help her retain her beauty and youth. The Witch directed her to a medicine spring that held the powers of The Great Spirit. But later, a rejected suitor named Wahsega kidnapped Trahlyta, and kept away from the waters of the spring, she faded and died. It is said if you place stones on her grave her spirit will bring you good fortune, but it is also said if you remove stones, the Witch of Cedar Mountain will curse you. Two times road construction workers have tried to move the stones, and both times the trucks have inexplicably wrecked off the side of the mountain, some people have even died. The spring, now called Porter Spring, is rumored to have healing powers.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.86", "longitude_y": "-84.388", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:58  DT", "city_latitude": "34.5261465", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Georgia", "state_abbrev": "GA", "binge drinking (%)": "15.1", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.6", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "69.3", "latitude_x": "34.6272485", "under 21 death percentage": "3.67", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:39  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "6931000000.0", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "moonset": "17:00  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "3953.0", "witness_count": "2", "location": "Stone Pile Gap", "longitude": "-83.96934159999999", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:51  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-83.9843953", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "55.3", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
