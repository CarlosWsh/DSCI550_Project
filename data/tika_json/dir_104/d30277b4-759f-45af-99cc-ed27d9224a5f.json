Her and her husband were extremely wealthy, and owned most of Oshkosh. They owned the larger factories, and paid their employees with, vouchers to purchase goods at stores the couple owned. Basically keeping all the money under their tight control. When the people of Oshkosh learned of the Paine center being built, they threatened the couple that if they ever moved into it, the people of Oshkosh would kill them. The couple feared the people of Oshkosh. And never did move it. In fact NO one has ever lived in the Paine Fine Art Center. Mr. Paine did pass on first, and Mrs. Paine did out live him. She donated their house to the city, with one stipulation, no children under 18 were allowed in it. She was never able to have children, and therefore resented children. Children are allowed in the center now, but Mrs. Paine is no longer alive. It's said that you can see the woman roaming the house during tours. The couple has also been seen together \"enjoying\" the house they dreamed of living in together. Workers often say a lady at the back of the crowd will start to explain things in the house but when they look for who was talking the place the voice came from can not be found.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.19", "longitude_y": "-89.4012", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "1.890359168241966", "city_latitude": "44.0247062", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:43  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "WI", "sun_upper_transit": "13:00  DT", "state_abbrev": "WI", "binge drinking (%)": "25.8", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "68.4", "latitude_x": "44.034873", "under 21 death percentage": "2.3", "usgs_region": "Midwest", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "4:54 am", "state_x": "Wisconsin", "taxpayer cost": "4453000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:44  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "", "latitude_y": "43.0731", "longitude": "-88.557369", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "10.0", "sunset": "20:41  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.7", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-88.5426136", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "63.2", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
