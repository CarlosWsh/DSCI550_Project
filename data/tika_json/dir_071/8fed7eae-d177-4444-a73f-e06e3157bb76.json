On January 8th, 1973, long before the park was built, the deranged serial killer beat, raped, hung, then buried 2 girls beneath the \"Devil Tree\". Over the next few days he returned to commit lewd acts to the bodies. In January 1977, almost 4 years to the day that the murders were committed, two fishermen discovered the skeletal remains of the two bodies, and the hanging ropes were also found. Over the years people have reported hearing screaming, and seeing hooded figures walking around the woods. In 1993 an exorcism was held, and a cross was erected, after two boys claimed to have seen a Satanic ritual taking place near the tree, and being chased away by the Satanists who yelled that they wanted their blood. Before the park was built, they were going to cut down the tree, but their chainsaws kept malfunctioning in the area surrounding the tree. They tried to cut down the tree manually with a two-man saw, but the teeth of the saw broke off, so they left the tree where it was.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.46", "year": "1973", "longitude_y": "-84.2807", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.5671077504725899", "city_latitude": "27.2730492", "begin_civil_twilight": "06:08  DT", "resident_population": "6789443.0", "state_y": "FL", "sunrise": "06:35  DT", "state_abbrev": "FL", "binge drinking (%)": "17.5", "resident_population_density_rank": "16.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "85.9", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "37.1", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "69.2", "latitude_x": "27.280132", "under 21 death percentage": "2.34", "usgs_region": "Southeast", "sun_upper_transit": "13:39  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Florida", "taxpayer cost": "15322000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "11:42  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "2", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "longitude": "-80.4086663", "latitude_y": "30.4383", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "3.0", "sunset": "20:42  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "1973/01/08", "city_longitude": "-80.3582261", "quarter": "1", "chronic death percentage": "60.8", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
