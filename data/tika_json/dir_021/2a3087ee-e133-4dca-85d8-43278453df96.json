Eliza is the \"Elizabeth\" Her spirit appears as her younger self, a girl of about 19, the age she was at her first marriage, a happier time for her. It is how she projects herself now, from memory. The \"old farmer, Will\" is her son J.T. Richards, who was the local meat cutter and grocer from the early 1900s until his death in 1937. The third ghost, Carrie, has been correctly identified. Caroline Jenkins Mooney lived in the house from the 1950s until her death in 1970. Waitresses and customers are always reporting strange things that happen--rude patrons having plates dumped on them, cold spots in the bathroom. Pictures have been taken that show a slender young woman in outline form. One is a farmer, one is an old woman who lived there, and one is a young girl who was murdered on her wedding day in the house. Supposedly a burglar attempted to burglarize the safe one night and seemed to leave in a hurry. - September 2004 update: The Catfish Plantation, which was partially burned in 2003, is now back up and open for business. The owners say that the three ghosts (Elizabeth, Will, and Caroline) are still present.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.69", "longitude_y": "-97.7431", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_latitude": "32.3865312", "begin_civil_twilight": "06:02  DT", "resident_population": "20851820.0", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Texas", "state_abbrev": "TX", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "30.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.9", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "22.8", "simple assault": "229.0", "latitude_y": "30.2672", "latitude_x": "", "under 21 death percentage": "3.97", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:33  DT", "city_sunrise": "5:33 am", "taxpayer cost": "18821000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "23:49  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "3", "median drinks per binge": "5.6", "longitude": "", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "time_of_day": "Morning", "binge drinking (%)": "17.6", "sunset": "20:36  DT", "robbery": "42.0", "hp_day": "2004/09/20", "city_longitude": "-96.8483311", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "56.9", "rape/sexual assault": "21.0"}
