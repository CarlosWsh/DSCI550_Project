The tombstone glows until you get to the edge of the cemetery, then it goes dark. You cant really pinpoint the actual tomb and there's no lights around to illuminate it either. Some say its made out of phosphorous and others say its mercury vapor reflecting off a shiny tombstone. but it doesn't explain why it goes dark when you get within 500 feet. the only close house to it is 1/4 mile away.
