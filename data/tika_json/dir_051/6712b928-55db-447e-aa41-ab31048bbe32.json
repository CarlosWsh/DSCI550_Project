At the beginning of the day and at the end of the day attractions workers must come on the PA system and tell George good morning and good night. If not the attraction has been know to shut itself down adding more work before the workers came go home for the night. - March 2004 Addition/ correction - when the ride was being built in the early 70's (it opened Dec. 15, 1973) , George was a welder who clearly, welded different parts of the scenes on the attraction together. One particular area on the ride, called the \"burning city\", required George to climb up quite high above the ground. George lost his balance, and fell to his death. If you talk to any of the employees at pirates, they will either know of someone who has had an incident with George, or there is a chance they move have had one themselves.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.46", "longitude_y": "-84.2807", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.5671077504725899", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "06:08  DT", "city_latitude": "28.5383355", "state_y": "FL", "sunrise": "06:36  DT", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "binge drinking (%)": "17.5", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "85.9", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "30.4383", "latitude_x": "28.385233", "under 21 death percentage": "2.34", "usgs_region": "Southeast", "sun_upper_transit": "13:39  DT", "city_sunrise": "5:31 am", "state_x": "Florida", "taxpayer cost": "15322000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:53  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "", "state_abbrev": "FL", "longitude": "-81.563874", "time_of_day": "Morning", "number_of_tribes": "3.0", "sunset": "20:42  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-81.3792365", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "60.8", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
