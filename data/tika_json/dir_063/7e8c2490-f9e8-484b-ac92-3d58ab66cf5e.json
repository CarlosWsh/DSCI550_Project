It was originally a cavalry base where the Buffalo Soldiers(first African American soldiers in the U.S. cavalry)were first introduced in New Mexico. After military use, a medical center was constructed and used as a TB center. It is now a long term care facility, and veterans hospital. In the basement (where the dungeon for the original base was) there have been sighting of wheelchairs rolling down the hall, door opening and closing, sounds of shackles and chains, moaning, crying, conversations, laughing, voices, people touching your shoulder, and apparition sightings, throughout the whole hospital on all 6 floors, esp. 2 west. In the housing area there are reports of hauntings, footsteps, late at night when everyone is asleep, apparitions, knocking on the doors and no one there, covers being torn off you.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.74", "year": "1800", "moon_upper_transit": "11:38  ST", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:17  ST", "city_latitude": "32.7961863", "state_y": "", "state_x": "New Mexico", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.6", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "35.6822", "latitude_x": "32.7890533", "resident_population_density": "", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:05  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "2233000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "19:23  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "12", "state_abbrev": "NM", "longitude": "-108.1576308", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "15.6", "sunset": "19:22  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "1800/01/01", "city_longitude": "-108.1503221", "curphase": "New Moon", "chronic death percentage": "61.2", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
