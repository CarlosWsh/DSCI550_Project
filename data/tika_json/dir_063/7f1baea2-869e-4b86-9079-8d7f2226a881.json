Workers hear noises at night and sometimes lights come off and on. Spirit does not like to be around when there are many people but late during the night you get a strange feeling of heaviness and even hairs sticking up on your arms. A spirit of a dog can also be sometimes heard and seen. Building has gone many extensive renovations. It was once an old house, and then renovated to a hair stylist, it also has been reported by several people to have been at one time a secret illegal meth production house that was shut down. Spirit has been felt standing behind people and in some cases breathing down their necks behind them or being lightly touched or pushed. The activity stems from the basement. Some workers refuse to go down there by themselves.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.08", "longitude_y": "-73.7562", "aggravated assault": "", "state_abbrev": "NY", "resident_population": "16782304.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:42  DT", "city_latitude": "42.6525793", "state_y": "NY", "state_x": "New York", "median drinks per binge": "5.4", "number_of_tribes": "2.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "7.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.4", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "13.2", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:57  DT", "latitude_x": "42.7181879", "resident_population_density": "356.1", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "usgs_region": "Northeast", "curphase": "Full Moon", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "16330000000.0", "hp_day": "1967/03/01", "moonset": "04:16  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "1", "latitude_y": "42.6526", "longitude": "-73.8071099", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "17.6", "sunset": "20:36  DT", "robbery": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.3780718336483932", "city_longitude": "-73.7562317", "quarter": "1", "chronic death percentage": "63.3", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
