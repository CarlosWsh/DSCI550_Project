In the 40's there were a lot of German and Italian POW's located on Ft. Carson. There is also an intricate system of tunnels linking the buildings together, one of the post's Military Police investigated an open door one night and deep into one of the tunnels he found an old setup of children\u2019s toys, a small chair, a small kids table and a few other things. There were also witnessed by three Military Policeman words painted inside an area under the building with no visible way to get inside and paint them there. The words didn't make any sense, and when they attempted to look for them on a later date they were gone, as if they\u2019d never been there. They weren't painted over because the surface wasn't painted, and they weren't sandblasted off either. On some nights especially when the weather gets colder, many strange noises are heard there. Movement is heard through the building, like furniture is being shoved around, repetitive banging noise, and sometimes faces are seen peering through the barred windows. an elder American Indian woman says the site was directly on the old trail of tears. She said that, there is a large low-lying field where no structure will stand; several attempts at building there have been unsuccessful.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.89", "longitude_y": "-104.9903", "aggravated assault": "", "city_latitude": "38.7421321", "begin_civil_twilight": "03:59  ST", "resident_population": "1123296.0", "state_y": "", "sunrise": "04:32  ST", "state_abbrev": "CO", "binge drinking (%)": "19.8", "resident_population_density_rank": "42.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "8.4", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "39.7392", "latitude_x": "38.7382327", "under 21 death percentage": "2.78", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:02  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Colorado", "taxpayer cost": "5057000000.0", "hp_day": "1941/07/06", "moonset": "16:43  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "3", "median drinks per binge": "5.6", "longitude": "-104.7846057", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "19:31  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_longitude": "-104.7920877", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "61.3", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
