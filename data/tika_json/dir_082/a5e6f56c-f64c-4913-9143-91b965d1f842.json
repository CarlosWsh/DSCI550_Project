After killing them he hung them from hooks in the meat shed in the back of the property. He was then chased through the woods near his home by the police until he was finally shot and killed near the road. Upon entering the grounds a strange feeling of being watched is felt, and if you go around to the back of the house you can still see the blood splattered in the meat shed. In the house you will find a staircase that leads into the ceiling. If you go into one of the upstairs bedrooms you will find women\u2019s shoes all over the floor and if you look out the window you will see what looks like a woman hanging from a rope in the tree. You can also still see the path that the ax man ran down to try to avoid the police. He is said to still haunt the bridge near where he died.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.51", "longitude_y": "-89.644", "city_latitude": "41.4444791", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:58  DT", "resident_population": "11113976.0", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Illinois", "state_abbrev": "IL", "binge drinking (%)": "20.5", "resident_population_density_rank": "12.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "82.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "10.2", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:00  DT", "latitude_x": "", "under 21 death percentage": "3.48", "usgs_region": "", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "9716000000.0", "hp_day": "1970/01/01", "moonset": "07:34  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "5151.0", "witness_count": "2", "median drinks per binge": "5.7", "longitude": "", "death rate increase (%)": "52.0", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:30  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_longitude": "-87.6314312", "curphase": "Waning Gibbous", "chronic death percentage": "57.4", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
