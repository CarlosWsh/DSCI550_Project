It was mysteriously shut down, and boarded up for reason related to asbestos. Located at Oak Park Rd. and Forest Preserve Rd. (Montrose ave.) in Chicago, you must park about a mile away and make the trip to the entrance on foot. Once inside you must pass numerous buildings marked: A, B, C, etc. Follow the main concrete path and follow it off to the left until you see a run down playground once used by the children who lived at the center. Go past the swing set and the 2nd slide you see and go between the two building before you. All but one of the windows around you will be boarded up. The one window that is not boarded up leads into the indoor pool. A main hallway can be reached through a room called the 'pool office'. From there you will find numerous stairwells that provide access to about 75% of the entire center. There are many reports of people hearing the sounds of children laughing, and in some instances even seeing people in white robes walking around. Lots of paranormal activity takes place in this abandoned asylum. - January 2006 update: This building is a construction site. Going to investigate this area or any other like it is foolish and reckless. Sneaking in to Construction areas under the pretence of \u201cGhost Hunters\u201d give the rest of us a bad name. It is Tresspassing.
