Almost all of the houses in this area have reported sightings, both of Indians and old-fashioned people. A janitor at the Middle School was working one night when a short, well-dressed man approached her. She asked him his name, and he bolted. She chased after him, and as he turned a corner, she could see that he no longer had a head. All of the janitors that have worked there have similar experiences, including strange noises and moving objects. In two houses in particular, about 2 blocks away from RMS, the activity is especially bad. They have reported apparitions, moving objects, and have even recorded clear voices on a cassette tape hidden in an upstairs bedroom while the family was away.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.15", "longitude_y": "-104.8202", "city_latitude": "41.7910697", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:53  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "WY", "state_x": "Wyoming", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "number_of_tribes": "2.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "85.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "41.1399", "latitude_x": "41.8026955", "under 21 death percentage": "2.59", "usgs_region": "Northwest", "sun_upper_transit": "13:01  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "593100000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:44  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "1", "state_abbrev": "WY", "longitude": "-107.2267776", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "18.5", "sunset": "20:35  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.5", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.3780718336483932", "city_longitude": "-107.2386627", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "60.8", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
