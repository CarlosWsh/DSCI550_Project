There is a 12-ft oak banister right in the doorway where the man is said to appear. Also strange noises in the bathroom and dining areas. Although it is used as a restaurant, nobody ventures into the attic where lights and other sightings have been witnessed. When standing/parked directly facing the front of the house, in the attic window on the right side of the house witnesses have seen the face of a man. He looked like he was wearing a blue war outfit (with big silver buttons.) He has reddish brown hair and a thin beard. (We took a flashlight with us on the night we saw him.)The building is located at 9-and Novi road, yet it can't seem to stay open for business. - November 2003 Update: The ghost believed to be haunting the place is actually in a painting that was placed over the window to patch a break in the pane.
