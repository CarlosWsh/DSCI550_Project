It has 3 floors, you can feel something as soon as you enter. It has many cold spots. The feeling of not being alone. A heavy smell of smoke & death as you enter the second floor & noises as if someone is following you up and down the stairs. At times you can see a patch of a bluish fog around the place. You can hear footsteps on the second and third floors. Doors slamming with no explanation and even being touch by something.
