Since her death things have happened. The day of her funeral she started knocking on doors of the house she was born in.1 month later as her clothes were to be removed the doors in the home flew open with no reason. Cold spots now can be felt & knocking at the door is still present to this day in the home. Also when there swings in the yard you could see them swing real high as if someone was swinging on them. lights like to go on & off in this home & she does move things to let someone know she is there. The cemetery where this child lies has had alot of activity also. When you visit her grave she has a twirly that will start going around & round with no reason or wind blowing to let you know she is present. Some have said she has been spotted walking the cemetery very restless as if she doesn't realize she has passed on.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.84", "longitude_y": "-84.5555", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "2.2684310018903595", "city_latitude": "41.986434", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:25  ST", "resident_population": "7823194.0", "state_y": "MI", "sunrise": "05:00  ST", "state_abbrev": "MI", "binge drinking (%)": "19.8", "resident_population_density_rank": "13.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "84.44", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "22.8", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:40  ST", "latitude_x": "41.9714248", "resident_population_density": "138.4", "usgs_region": "Midwest", "curphase": "Waxing Gibbous", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Michigan", "taxpayer cost": "8162000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "02:58  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "4", "latitude_y": "42.7335", "longitude": "-84.3818434", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "12.0", "sunset": "20:20  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "1964/07/31", "city_longitude": "-84.3471684", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "59.6", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
