There have been sightings of a pair of legs, and a man wearing a pink shirt and khakis in the stone hallway of the lower school. Basketballs roll across the gym by themselves. There was a person killed in the shower in the bathroom and a student went in there and her nose started bleeding. As soon as she left, it stopped. In the Photography Darkroom, strange things have happened. Like markers fly through the air and doors open and close, radio stations always change to the same country station, and the water overflows in the sink and floods the floor. Last year, a student fell asleep in the lounge, and the gates were locked at the end of school. He was locked in the upstairs of the gym building overnight with no cell phone to call anyone. He figured he\u2019d be fine and he\u2019d just continue sleeping in the lounge, but he couldn\u2019t stand it because he kept hearing footsteps walking up and down the hallway. When kids arrived at school the next day, they saw the student asleep at the bottom of the steps right behind the gate. He said that\u2019s the only place that he couldn\u2019t hear the footsteps.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.59", "moon_upper_transit": "10:15  ST", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "11319366.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:05  ST", "city_latitude": "40.0890224", "state_y": "", "sunrise": "04:38  ST", "state_abbrev": "PA", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "9.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.7", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "7.8", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "40.2732", "latitude_x": "40.099727", "under 21 death percentage": "2.67", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:09  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Pennsylvania", "taxpayer cost": "9544000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "17:26  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "5", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "longitude": "-75.724957", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "binge drinking (%)": "18.5", "sunset": "19:41  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "1960/06/30", "city_longitude": "-75.7725054", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "52.4", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
