In the Gramley dorm, it is said that the floor, which is now the third floor of the building, was once the attic. Long ago, a girl went up to the attic and hung herself. It is said that at night, girls on the second floor can hear the girl's spirit dragging a trunk across the floor to where she is going to hang herself. No one on the third floor can hear it though. Also in this building, people on the second floor have heard marbles dropping on the ceiling and rolling across the floor. Reports of furniture being moved when no one is in the room, random knocking on open doors and the presence of a female ghost also occurred in this building.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.85", "moon_upper_transit": "09:28  DT", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.945179584120983", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:29  DT", "city_latitude": "36.1039642", "state_y": "NC", "state_x": "North Carolina", "state_abbrev": "NC", "binge drinking (%)": "15.8", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "82.7", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "69.5", "latitude_x": "36.09985959999999", "under 21 death percentage": "3.08", "usgs_region": "Southeast", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "7034000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:40  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "3", "location": "Salem", "longitude": "-80.244216", "latitude_y": "35.7804", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "5.0", "sunset": "20:34  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-80.254435", "quarter": "1", "chronic death percentage": "56.3", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
