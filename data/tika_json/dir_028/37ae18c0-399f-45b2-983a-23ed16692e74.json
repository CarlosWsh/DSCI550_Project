Take the Truxton exit and get off at the service road. Follow the service road and watch on the right. You'll know when you've found the house. No history is known.

And a dark shadow figure has been seen in the top left window. There\u2019s always an overpowering sense that someone is watching you from that top window, and it's a horrible feeling.  NO TRESSPASSING  This is house is  PRIVATE,  and the owners who live down the road do not like visitors. - December 2005 Update/Additional Information: there was a family who lived there.
