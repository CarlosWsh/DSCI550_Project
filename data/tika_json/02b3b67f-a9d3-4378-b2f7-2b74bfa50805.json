There was a couple that had a farmhouse near Gadsden. The couple got into a heated argument, in which the woman finally ran away with her baby. Feeling sorry for his family, the man of the house got on his carriage and searched for his wife. Hiding near the bridge, the woman appeared out of the bushes and scared the horses. The horses knocked both her and the baby into Black Creek, drowning both of them. Since then, a woman can be seen walking the banks of Black Creek, carriage wheels are heard, and a baby's cry is sometimes heard. Many people have had different experiences, and one of the houses near the bridge was reported to have had an exorcism performed.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.06", "moon_upper_transit": "09:00  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.945179584120983", "city_latitude": "34.014264", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:10  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "AL", "state_x": "Alabama", "state_abbrev": "AL", "binge drinking (%)": "13.6", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "79.9", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "71.5", "latitude_x": "", "under 21 death percentage": "3.94", "usgs_region": "Southeast", "sun_upper_transit": "12:47  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "3724000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:05  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "2208.0", "witness_count": "2", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "longitude": "", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "5.0", "sunset": "19:55  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.7", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-86.0066386", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "49.8", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
