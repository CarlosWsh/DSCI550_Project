Merchandise flying off the shelves, stereos turning on or changing channels by themselves, trails of muddy footprints that appear on clean floors, to numerous unexplained electrical problems with the security system mainly reporting movement when the store was totally empty of people. There have been reports of cold spots, mysterious mists or fogs in the building, and many cases of workers feeling that someone was standing behind them and even seeing shadows behind them and turning and no one is there. There have been a few sightings of a black human form seen walking through the store, sometimes right through displays. The store was built on an old homestead that had on it a family cemetary. They moved the bodies when they built the store, but they say that some of the older graves were unmarked and that they missed some of them, thus the haunting of the store by restless spirits.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.19", "year": "1996", "longitude_y": "-89.4012", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "1.890359168241966", "resident_population": "4891769.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:43  DT", "city_latitude": "44.0288803", "state_y": "WI", "sun_upper_transit": "12:59  DT", "state_abbrev": "WI", "binge drinking (%)": "25.8", "resident_population_density_rank": "26.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "4.0", "simple assault": "527.0", "latitude_y": "43.0731", "latitude_x": "44.02368999999999", "resident_population_density": "90.3", "median binges monthly": "1.7", "usgs_region": "Midwest", "quarter": "3", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Wisconsin", "taxpayer cost": "4453000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "23:52  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "3", "location": "Wal-Mart", "longitude": "-88.139123", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "10.0", "sunset": "20:41  DT", "robbery": "100.0", "hp_day": "1996/09/01", "city_longitude": "-88.16287849999999", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "63.2", "rape/sexual assault": "29.0"}
