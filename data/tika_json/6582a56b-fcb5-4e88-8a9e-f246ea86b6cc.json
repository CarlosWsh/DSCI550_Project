Security and maintenance personnel have had doors locked behind them during the early morning hours. One of the first floor boardrooms has a particularly obvious cold spot and a feeling of dread, as well as the smell of decay. In 1926 a nursing student, distraught over failing grades, took her own life by jumping from the roof onto the stone walk of the courtyard below. The doorway she used to gain access to roof will reportedly not stay closed on the anniversary of the event. A nurse there comes in every morning to the basement section and always has to close the 75lbs lead door to the x-ray room, when she is positive they close this every night before the last doctor leaves.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.84", "moon_upper_transit": "21:23  ST", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "2.2684310018903595", "city_latitude": "42.331427", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:25  ST", "resident_population": "3668412.0", "state_y": "MI", "state_x": "Michigan", "state_abbrev": "MI", "number_of_tribes": "12.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "14.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "84.44", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "30.5", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:40  ST", "latitude_x": "42.3673317", "under 21 death percentage": "2.57", "usgs_region": "Midwest", "quarter": "4", "city_sunrise": "5:33 am", "taxpayer cost": "8162000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "02:20  ST", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "3", "latitude_y": "42.7335", "longitude": "-83.08518980000001", "time_of_day": "Morning", "binge drinking (%)": "19.8", "sunset": "20:20  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "1926/10/13", "city_longitude": "-83.0457538", "curphase": "Waxing Gibbous", "chronic death percentage": "59.6", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
