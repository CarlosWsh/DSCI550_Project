A previous theatre manager related a story about an incident that occurred to him, when he was all-alone in the theatre. Apparently on day as he was walking across the stage he looked out at the seats where the customers would sit. And he saw one seat about 3-4 rows from the front and 2 seats in rocking slowly all by itself. There are other stories to be told of the hauntings there, but all you need to do...is come, and visit with the staff at the American Theatre.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.15", "moon_upper_transit": "21:00  ST", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.1890359168241966", "state_abbrev": "IA", "city_latitude": "42.7496413", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:06  ST", "resident_population": "2404021.0", "state_y": "IA", "state_x": "Iowa", "median drinks per binge": "5.8", "binge drinking (%)": "24.5", "resident_population_density_rank": "26.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "88.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "8.1", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:16  ST", "latitude_x": "42.7497807", "resident_population_density": "43.0", "usgs_region": "Midwest", "quarter": "4", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "1934000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "01:58  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "1", "location": "American Theatre", "longitude": "-95.5506955", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "1.0", "sunset": "19:52  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "hp_day": "1926/12/25", "city_longitude": "-95.5515431", "curphase": "Waxing Gibbous", "chronic death percentage": "67.0", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
