The mysterious lady has appeared in the dining area in various forms. Sometimes, just her hand will appear wearing a huge ring. She then materializes in the fountain behind the bar. The woman is believed to be Colonel Skene's wife. When she died, the colonel placed her body in a led lined coffin, which he kept in part of the house.
