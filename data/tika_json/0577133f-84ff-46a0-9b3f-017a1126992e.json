The legend has it, that if you go there at midnight on a full moon only, that the statue cries bloody tears. It sometimes lasts till 1:00 A.M. And during this \"witching\" hour, it's said that you can walk through the graveyard, and hear the faint voices of the dead. Some people (including myself) have seen a white woman in the back of the cemetery coming out of the wall of one of the old crypts and walking along the row of headstones. She carries a white cat with no head, and cries mournfully. Legend says that she was a lady who lived in the area in the late 1920s. Her indoor cat ran outside and she ran after it. When she scooped her beloved cat up in her arms in the middle of the street, they were both run over by a beer wagon.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.47", "moon_upper_transit": "17:03  ST", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "state_abbrev": "MO", "resident_population": "3404055.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:12  ST", "city_latitude": "36.6208917", "state_y": "", "sunrise": "04:44  ST", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "22.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "80.2", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "3.4", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:10  ST", "latitude_x": "36.6523128", "under 21 death percentage": "3.72", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "usgs_region": "", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Missouri", "taxpayer cost": "4604000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "23:18  ST", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "4", "latitude_y": "38.5767", "longitude": "-90.7600522", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "18.9", "sunset": "19:36  ST", "robbery": "", "hp_day": "1920/07/31", "city_longitude": "-90.8234551", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "52.5", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
