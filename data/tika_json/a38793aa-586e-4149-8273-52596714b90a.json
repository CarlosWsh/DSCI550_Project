The prison itself was a female prison prior to 1982, and has its own graveyard for several female inmates that passed away while in custody. - October 2007 Update/ Additional Information: It was previously used for different things; an infirmary, and solitary confinement. Many people have claimed to have had experiences there. Nothing too concrete. The prison itself was a female reformatory opening in the early 1900s. Many of the old buildings are extremely creepy, and many odd sounds are heard. Most can be attributed to old pipes, but once in a while, the hair does go up on the back of one's neck. The cemetery contains graves of women and babies, presumably that died during childbirth. What really adds to the \"haunted\" feeling is the giant old twisted oak trees that surround the older buildings.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.15", "longitude_y": "-93.6208", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.1890359168241966", "city_latitude": "42.3952576", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:06  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "IA", "state_x": "Iowa", "state_abbrev": "IA", "binge drinking (%)": "24.5", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "88.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "69.4", "latitude_x": "42.3923276", "resident_population_density": "", "usgs_region": "Midwest", "sun_upper_transit": "13:16  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "1934000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:58  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "5", "location": "North Central Correctional Facility", "longitude": "-94.6056148", "latitude_y": "41.5908", "time_of_day": "Morning", "number_of_tribes": "1.0", "sunset": "20:52  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-94.6338671", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "67.0", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
