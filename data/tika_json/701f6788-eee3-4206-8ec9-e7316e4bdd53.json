It was on a Wednesday before the regular poetry reading. A woman was awake on a couch, but she couldn\u2019t get her eyes to open completely. With her blurred vision, she thought she saw her friend walk into the kitchen. The woman asked a man sitting in a chair near her if there was anyone else in the room. The man told her that everyone was in the kitchen. She then felt a pair of female hands grab her roughly and hold her down to the couch. She yelled out to the guy sitting in the chair, asking if there was anyone else in the room. He went to the kitchen and saw that no one was there and told her that they were the only two people there. As soon as he told her that, the hands let go. When the woman arrived for work the next day, she told her coworkers the story. She said that she had seen he r friend out of the corner of her eye, and that the friend was wearing the exact same clothes that she saw him wearing earlier that day. The other person who was with her at the time said that he had been sitting in the chair the whole time, and had seen nothing out of the ordinary. He also said that he had seen the woman\u2019s friend walk into the kitchen. The Poet's Loft is located at 514B Central Avenue in Hot Springs, in the famous Bathhouse Row district.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.06", "year": "1996", "moon_upper_transit": "17:31  DT", "aggravated assault": "184.0", "resident_population": "2350725.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:27  DT", "city_latitude": "34.5037004", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Arkansas", "state_abbrev": "AR", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "37.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.4", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "2.8", "simple assault": "618.0", "male death percentage": "69.8", "latitude_x": "", "under 21 death percentage": "3.55", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:11  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "2073000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "23:58  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "1407.0", "witness_count": "2", "median drinks per binge": "5.6", "longitude": "", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "binge drinking (%)": "16.0", "sunset": "20:26  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_longitude": "-93.0551795", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "55.7", "rape/sexual assault": "35.0", "robbery": "90.0"}
