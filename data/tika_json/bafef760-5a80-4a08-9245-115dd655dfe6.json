It is believed that your car will stall and will not start again until the pork is taken out of your car. Some locals believe that is the menehune (meh-neh-hoo-neh), mischievous, elflike creatures, that stops you. Others believe it is because Kamapua'a(kah-mah-po-ah-ah), the giant, nine-eyed boar god who lives in the forests of Kaneohe, won't allow you to pass until the pork is taken out of your car. And this means going in either direction- from Honolulu to Kaneohe or Kaneohe to Honolulu. Many locals, to this day, practice this custom whether they believe or not.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.13", "moon_upper_transit": "09:57  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "state_abbrev": "HI", "city_latitude": "21.3069444", "begin_civil_twilight": "06:26  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Hawaii", "median drinks per binge": "5.7", "binge drinking (%)": "20.9", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "87.8", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "72.6", "latitude_x": "21.3417501", "resident_population_density": "", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:33  DT", "city_sunrise": "5:37 am", "taxpayer cost": "937400000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:44  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "526.0", "witness_count": "", "latitude_y": "21.307", "longitude": "-157.8271717", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:16  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-157.8583333", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "61.2", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
