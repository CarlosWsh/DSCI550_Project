When the driver turns around to tell her to pay, the bus is empty. Some drivers of cars on 87th St. have reported seeing \"heads\" floating above gravestones,( or late night \"visitors\" peeking from behind?) and people sitting on some of the stone benches in cemetery at night. As this cemetery has no fence a more mundane explanation could fit. The Writer has seen vehicles drive right off of Kedzie, over the curb, and into the cemetery at night. This was before this section of the cemetery along Kedzie was sold to the village of Evergreen Park, which built a firehouse, and a skating rink on the site. The Boundaries of the cemetery are 87th St. to the north, 91st St. to the south, Kedzie Ave to the east(actually behind the above mentioned firehouse, but visible from the street), and the B & O Railroad tracks to the west. On the other side of the tracks, is a separate cemetery, St. Mary's, more on that cemetery to follow.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.51", "moon_upper_transit": "09:14  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "city_latitude": "41.7205889", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:58  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Illinois", "median drinks per binge": "5.7", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "82.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:00  DT", "latitude_x": "41.7318314", "under 21 death percentage": "3.48", "usgs_region": "", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "9716000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:36  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "", "state_abbrev": "IL", "longitude": "-87.7072584", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "20.5", "sunset": "20:30  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_longitude": "-87.7017175", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "57.4", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
