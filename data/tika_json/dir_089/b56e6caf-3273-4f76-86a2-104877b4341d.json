It resides a neighborhood called Hathaway Hills. The story behind the house is that Charlie Chaplin used to own the house and sold it for whatever reason? In any case, a man moved in with his family. And soon after the house would lead to his and his family's demise. He came home from work one afternoon and killed his mother, his wife and children. People describe the house as a spooky and haunting location. Curious kids went to the house and saw the same Mercedes Benz crashed into the garage with \"police tape\" stuck to the side of the house and front porch. It has been reported that one can see a mirage of the grandmother and hear the children screaming. There have been other reports of eerie sounds and sightings of wild animals, for example, a lion. Lastly, the house has a dark side and lighter sid e. Today one can see a single window with a table lamp on shining noticeably. The house is an old Victorian style, also it looks like the Psycho house used in the actual film.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.29", "longitude_y": "-121.478851", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "16.824196597353495", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:10  DT", "city_latitude": "34.0781593", "state_y": "CA", "state_x": "California", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "binge drinking (%)": "16.6", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "38.575764", "latitude_x": "", "under 21 death percentage": "2.49", "usgs_region": "Pacific", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "35011000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:48  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "1", "state_abbrev": "CA", "longitude": "", "time_of_day": "Afternoon", "number_of_tribes": "89.0", "sunset": "20:34  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-118.2605574", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "64.4", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
