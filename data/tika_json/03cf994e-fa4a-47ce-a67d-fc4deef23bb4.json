The boy told them that he got lost from his dad and asked the men for help. One man went with the boy into the woods just left of the parking lot, The other fisherman decided to stay with the car. At around 2:30 am, the man heard the little boy laughing. So he realized that the boy must have found his father. So he waited for them to get back. He got back in his truck and sat for a little while. Then he heard some rustling coming from the trail, and figured that it was his friend. he looked over and didn't see anything. And then, right beside the driver seat door he heard the little boy again, laughing. When he got out he saw the boy standing at the trail again. Then the boy told him that they found his father and that he should come and see him. The man told the boy to go get his friend. The boy just kept saying that his dad had something really neat to show him and that he should go and see. The man turned on the truck and peeled out. Just as he was leaving the area, he heard the boy laughing again off in the distance, and his friend was never seen again. Since then there have been many reports of hearing a little boy laughing coming from the bushes at night.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.04", "longitude_y": "-86.7816", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "state_abbrev": "TN", "resident_population": "6346105.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:00  DT", "city_latitude": "35.9828412", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Tennessee", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "21.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.8", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "11.5", "simple assault": "375.0", "sun_upper_transit": "12:49  DT", "latitude_x": "36.0427571", "under 21 death percentage": "2.95", "median binges monthly": "1.7", "usgs_region": "", "curphase": "Waning Gibbous", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "4684000000.0", "hp_day": "2016/07/06", "moonset": "06:43  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "1", "location": "Fate Sanders Recreation Area", "longitude": "-86.4851233", "latitude_y": "36.1627", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "15.7", "sunset": "20:08  DT", "robbery": "56.0", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-86.5186045", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "55.3", "rape/sexual assault": "39.0"}
