He slipped and fell in the turbines, and was killed. Several fishermen have claimed they have seen the boy walking at the top of the dam sobbing. Most sightings have been in the early morning before sunrise. The boy's figure is illuminated by the lights at the top of the dam, and he is said to be walking about ten feet above the wall. The fisherman of the community seem to believe he is a sign of good luck, who ever spots him seems to have a prosperous day.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.84", "moon_upper_transit": "03:29  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "resident_population": "8875083.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:25  DT", "city_latitude": "43.4194319", "state_y": "MI", "state_x": "Michigan", "state_abbrev": "MI", "binge drinking (%)": "19.8", "resident_population_density_rank": "13.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "84.44", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "13.4", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "67.9", "latitude_x": "43.437111", "resident_population_density": "157.0", "usgs_region": "Midwest", "sun_upper_transit": "13:40  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "8162000000.0", "hp_day": "1970/01/01", "moonset": "08:02  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "2", "latitude_y": "42.7335", "longitude": "-85.66338909999999", "curphase": "Waning Gibbous", "time_of_day": "Morning", "number_of_tribes": "12.0", "sunset": "21:20  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "2.2684310018903595", "city_longitude": "-85.62292959999999", "quarter": "1", "chronic death percentage": "59.6", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
