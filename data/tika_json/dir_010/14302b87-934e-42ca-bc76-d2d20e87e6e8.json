It had a fire that occurred in the attic when the original owners had it(somewhere in the late 1800's early 1900's). Some people died in the fire. The attic was converted into living space for the fraternity. Brothers living in the attic have reported waking up in the middle of the night to see figures standing in there (locked) room, staring with red eyes. The figures would basically just stare with a angered look in there eyes and vanish. Brothers would also hear footsteps around the attic area(hall & stairs)when no one is present. Some have woke up with one of the ghosts face just a foot away from their own face.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.84", "moon_upper_transit": "07:13  ST", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "2.2684310018903595", "city_latitude": "42.680588", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:24  ST", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "MI", "sun_upper_transit": "12:40  ST", "state_abbrev": "MI", "number_of_tribes": "12.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "84.44", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "67.9", "latitude_x": "42.66884830000001", "under 21 death percentage": "2.57", "usgs_region": "Midwest", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "5:11 am", "state_x": "Michigan", "taxpayer cost": "8162000000.0", "hp_day": "1870/03/16", "moonset": "13:19  ST", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "4548.0", "witness_count": "4", "latitude_y": "42.7335", "longitude": "-83.20664149999999", "time_of_day": "Morning", "binge drinking (%)": "19.8", "sunset": "20:20  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-83.1338214", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "59.6", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
