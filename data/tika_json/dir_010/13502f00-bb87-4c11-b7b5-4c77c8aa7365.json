They left the money in their wagon until the morning so they would have time to decide. When the family awoke, the money was gone. Mr. McGreen was so mad that he killed everyone and hung himself in the well. Strange things happened in the house for almost 200 years later. Doors would open by themselves. Pets refused to go into the dining room nor would plants ever live in it. Small fires would start in the fireplace on their own. Door handles would be witnessed as wiggled when no one was on the other side to do so. Shadows are seen and images are seen outside a huge picture window that looks over a river. the well is still there and nothing will grow with in a 10 feet radius of it. In 1979, the house mysteriously burned down without any indication of a cause.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.84", "year": "1800", "longitude_y": "-82.9988", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:30  ST", "city_latitude": "41.4489396", "state_y": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:33  ST", "state_abbrev": "OH", "binge drinking (%)": "17.2", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "54.8", "latitude_x": "", "under 21 death percentage": "2.63", "usgs_region": "", "quarter": "4", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Ohio", "taxpayer cost": "8520000000.0", "hp_day": "1800/12/31", "moonset": "20:04  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "4", "latitude_y": "39.9612", "longitude": "", "time_of_day": "Morning", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:04  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-82.7079605", "curphase": "New Moon", "chronic death percentage": "54.8", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
