When they checked all over, they found no one around. In one event, a typewriter started typing by itself. Another time, a very old record player started playing by itself.

NOTHING could have fallen on the bell, or have made it ring. There\u2019s a toilet in the basement that nobody uses, and one day 2 employees were upstairs and heard a loud crash. When investigating downstairs, they realized the toilet seat was down, when it was left up. All these events occurred over much time, and not very often.
