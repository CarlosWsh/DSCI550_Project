He one day was driving home and wrapped his car around a tree; his ghost has haunted the Blackbox ever since. In the storage room, the noise of moving chairs and other items can often be heard. In the classroom, the motion sensor light turns on when the door is locked and nobody is in there. Footsteps up the steps and around the building are common. Movement upstairs and in the catwalks is also very common. While Charlie in the Clegg building usually causes commotion at night, Jesse seems to be around 24 hours a day- even while there are large groups and classes in the theatre.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.86", "moon_upper_transit": "12:30  DT", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_latitude": "34.9331453", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:58  DT", "resident_population": "6478216.0", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Georgia", "state_abbrev": "GA", "binge drinking (%)": "15.1", "resident_population_density_rank": "23.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.6", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "18.6", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "69.3", "latitude_x": "34.932492", "under 21 death percentage": "3.67", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:39  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "6931000000.0", "hp_day": "1990/03/01", "moonset": "20:08  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "3", "location": "Young Harris College", "longitude": "-83.84682", "time_of_day": "Morning", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:51  DT", "robbery": "", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-83.8471223", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "55.3", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
