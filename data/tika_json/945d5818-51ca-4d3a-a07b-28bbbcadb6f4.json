Many years ago it was storming very bad one night one of the girls needed to a shower. So she walked to the shower house about 6 or 7 yards from the tents. In girl scouts you have to use the buddy system and she didn\u2019t. She was told to wait till morning and chose not to. She was struck by lightning in the shower house. She was found the next morning burned so badly it was hard to identify her. They don\u2019t use the old shower house any more. Late at night if you sit outside you tent you can see a girl wraped in a towel walking back from the shower house. - March 2008 Update: This is a possible urban legend. there is no shower house by the tents described.
