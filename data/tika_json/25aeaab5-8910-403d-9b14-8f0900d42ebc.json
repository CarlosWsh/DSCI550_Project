About 10-15ft from the area at which the camper's sleep is a steep hill (about 80deg.), with a large creek at the bottom. A boy known as Riley was found at the bottom of that hill in the creek one morning after a campout. He was though to have slept walked off the side of the hill. After his death a healthy cluster of trees started to grow in one knot like tree. The tree now resembles a throne, but what is weird about it is, the part you would sit on looks like a face(said to be the devils throne).", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.08", "longitude_y": "-73.7562", "aggravated assault": "", "city_latitude": "42.3806287", "begin_civil_twilight": "03:42  ST", "resident_population": "10385227.0", "state_y": "NY", "sunrise": "04:17  ST", "median drinks per binge": "5.4", "number_of_tribes": "2.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "7.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.4", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "14.0", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "67.2", "latitude_x": "42.3628199", "resident_population_density": "220.4", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "usgs_region": "Northeast", "sun_upper_transit": "11:56  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "New York", "taxpayer cost": "16330000000.0", "hp_day": "1927/06/30", "moonset": "10:53  ST", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "1", "state_abbrev": "NY", "longitude": "-76.9209135", "curphase": "Waning Gibbous", "time_of_day": "Morning", "binge drinking (%)": "17.6", "sunset": "19:36  ST", "robbery": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.3780718336483932", "city_longitude": "-76.8732921", "quarter": "2", "chronic death percentage": "63.3", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
