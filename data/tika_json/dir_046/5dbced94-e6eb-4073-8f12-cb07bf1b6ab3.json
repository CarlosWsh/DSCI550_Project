Don't know if this still continues today. The door into the room from the hallway, as well as the door into the bathroom, would open and shut on their own, the main door even if it had been locked. After closing, it would be locked again. There was also a spot on one wall (a wall that the room shared with a boarded up, no longer used laundry shaft) where two points of light would appear, shaped similar to eyes. Attempts were made to explain their appearance (they were visible any time it was dark in the room). They were screened off from the windows to see if they might be reflections, they weren't. When objects were placed between them and the windows they actually became brighter. We tried painting the walls, putting several coats of paint over them (thinking they may have been a joke of a previous resident, made with glow in the dark paint) - also having used sandpaper on the wall in that spot first before painting. They still appeared bright as ever after the painting. We tried covering them over by hanging a picture over them, but the picture kept falling down or moving. Last attempt to hang picture (it was a drawing on a piece of paper and simply taped to the wall) resulted in us waking up the next morning to find it taped to the ceiling over my bed. We finally moved a tall dresser in front of it and that seemed to take care of it. Reports from later residents told us that they had placed a mirror over it, and they had a rocker in the room. One night during a party, with several witnesses, the rocker began rocking on its own, then flew back and smashed the mirror. Have had no contact with the school since graduation, so don't know if these things still happen or not.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.84", "moon_upper_transit": "03:29  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "2.2684310018903595", "city_latitude": "41.8975471", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:25  DT", "resident_population": "8875083.0", "state_y": "MI", "state_x": "Michigan", "state_abbrev": "MI", "binge drinking (%)": "19.8", "resident_population_density_rank": "13.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "84.44", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "13.4", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:40  DT", "latitude_x": "41.9057124", "resident_population_density": "157.0", "usgs_region": "Midwest", "curphase": "Waning Gibbous", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "8162000000.0", "hp_day": "1970/10/31", "moonset": "08:02  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "6", "latitude_y": "42.7335", "longitude": "-84.0175653", "time_of_day": "Morning", "number_of_tribes": "12.0", "sunset": "21:20  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-84.03716589999999", "quarter": "4", "chronic death percentage": "59.6", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
