As an inexperienced rock climber, he decided to take his chances anyway and go climbing for the day. For the most part, he had a pretty good day--until he decided to climb down to the tunnel (otherwise known as the Nada Tunnel). It was dark outside and he wasn't wearing any bright or distinctive colored clothing and as his luck would have it, his rope broke. Just as he was falling, a big green bus from the job corps came by and hit him as he was falling. To this day, the tunnel still glows from his presence. At 1:17am, the tunnel will glow for 13 minutes (the length of time it took him to die). Witnesses say, as he was dying he mentioned seeing \"the glow\". Now every year on October 29th, at 1:17am, the tunnel glows.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.19", "longitude_y": "-84.8753", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:45  DT", "city_latitude": "37.7950836", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Kentucky", "state_abbrev": "KY", "binge drinking (%)": "15.8", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.7", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "38.1868", "latitude_x": "37.8072459", "under 21 death percentage": "2.67", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:41  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "3195000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "17:12  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "4", "location": "Tunnel Ridge", "longitude": "-83.667424", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "21:06  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-83.70408069999999", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "53.5", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
