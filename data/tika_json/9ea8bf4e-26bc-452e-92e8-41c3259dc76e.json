Convicts were brought in to complete work on a tunnel right outside of Dillsboro. To get to the site, the men had to cross a section of the Tuckaseegee River on raft. One day, the raft flipped over in the rain-swollen river and all of the convicts died (except one) because they were chained together. The men were buried on the mountain above the tunnel. Sometimes, especially after a big rain, people report hearing chains rattling and the echoes of men splashing in water yelling for help. **Interesting fact about this tunnel** This is the same tunnel Harrison Ford walks into in the movie 'The Fugitive'.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.85", "moon_upper_transit": "16:20  ST", "aggravated assault": "", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:28  ST", "city_latitude": "35.3692665", "state_y": "NC", "state_x": "North Carolina", "state_abbrev": "NC", "binge drinking (%)": "15.8", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "82.7", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "69.5", "latitude_x": "35.429769", "under 21 death percentage": "3.08", "usgs_region": "Southeast", "sun_upper_transit": "12:16  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "7034000000.0", "hp_day": "1863/07/31", "moonset": "22:46  ST", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "4452.0", "witness_count": "", "latitude_y": "35.7804", "longitude": "-83.44771399999999", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "5.0", "sunset": "19:34  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.945179584120983", "city_longitude": "-83.2523705", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "56.3", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
