This is not accurate. The casino was in fact on the second floor. However, laundry carts have been reported by the staff to move on their own in the basement. The front desk will often get calls from (3) rooms in the hotel on a regular basis that no one has checked into. The 10th floor has one room in particular (room #1009) where the staff say when they try to open the door to the room they get resistance on the other side as if someone doesn't want you to come in. Lots of activity has been captured in this room. A congressman also lived in the hotel at one time who also killed himself at the hotel. He lived on the 10th floor.
