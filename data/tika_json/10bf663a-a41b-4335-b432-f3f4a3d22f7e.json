The first librarian died of unknown causes and people say they see her ghost walking around in the basement. Many of the workers hear her footsteps downstairs after hours and some claim to have seen her ghost. Some people have researched her death and went to her gravesite only to find out that her grave was unmarked. They believe that if they buy a tombstone and have another ceremony she will be put to rest to no longer haunt the library. The library will be moving to a new location within the year and they hope to have her settled by then.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.01", "moon_upper_transit": "07:25  ST", "state_abbrev": "WA", "city_latitude": "47.91287560000001", "begin_civil_twilight": "03:36  ST", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "WA", "sunrise": "04:16  ST", "median drinks per binge": "5.3", "binge drinking (%)": "15.4", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "87.2", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:13  ST", "latitude_x": "47.915157", "resident_population_density": "", "median binges monthly": "1.5", "usgs_region": "Northwest", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Washington", "taxpayer cost": "5805000000.0", "hp_day": "1900/01/01", "moonset": "14:38  ST", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "3184.0", "witness_count": "4", "location": "Snohomish public library", "longitude": "-122.088498", "time_of_day": "Morning", "number_of_tribes": "30.0", "sunset": "20:10  ST", "robbery": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "5.671077504725898", "city_longitude": "-122.0981847", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "64.6", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
