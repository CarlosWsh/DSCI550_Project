Now door slam shut and thing are moved. One teacher was there late at night alone cutting paper in the workroom. When he heard someone in the hall, he looked out and no one was there, again he heard it he checks the whole school and no one was there. When he came back to the workroom all his trash was gone. When teachers would work late, small children could be heard, but not seen and an old man is heard roaming the halls. Teachers were heard teaching. And in a non-personal account (heard from teacher who was there): She was designing the bulletin board when she heard ghostly footsteps in the hall. Her daughter and her were alone in the building. Her daughter chased them and when this teacher looked out in the hall, her girl was walking with her arm in the air as if grasping an adults'. But there was no one. She called her daughter back and the girl explained, she was just walking with the nice old man. Possibly the janitor. One teacher had some students there to help with a project one night. When it was time to leave, he sent the students left and right into the building to make sure no one was still inside. The students met after completing the search and began to leave when they heard running footsteps and voices coming down the stairs. Update: the haunted portion of the school is no longer open to students or teachers.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.85", "year": "1940", "longitude_y": "-78.6391", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.945179584120983", "city_latitude": "35.5456947", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:28  ST", "resident_population": "3571623.0", "state_y": "NC", "state_x": "North Carolina", "state_abbrev": "NC", "binge drinking (%)": "15.8", "resident_population_density_rank": "16.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "82.7", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "12.7", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "69.5", "latitude_x": "35.546499", "under 21 death percentage": "3.08", "usgs_region": "Southeast", "sun_upper_transit": "12:16  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "7034000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "06:43  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "5", "location": "Corriher-Lipe Middle School", "longitude": "-80.61489499999999", "latitude_y": "35.7804", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "5.0", "sunset": "19:34  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "1940/10/01", "city_longitude": "-80.6108998", "quarter": "4", "chronic death percentage": "56.3", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
