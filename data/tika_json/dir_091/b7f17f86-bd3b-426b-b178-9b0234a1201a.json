The stories range from footsteps around, and above the listener to doors opening and closing themselves, and even sightings of full body apparitions of former clinic employees. Moving cold spots, fluctuating EMF readings, various orb photos, and such are common in the building especially on the third floor. There have been several very clear EVPs caught in and around the former operating room, and in various places on the third floor of the building, as well as in the former morgue area. The voices captured seem to be that of doctor and nurses talking just before, or during a surgery, and of a man screaming, and moaning in pain. Also, at least one home video exists of heavy footsteps walking, and then running across the floor above the listeners, and of a hallway door shutting itself, opening itself, and then slamming its self shut. The most compelling evidence this video holds is of a lock on the third floor hallway door unexplainably unlatching its self right before your eyes, and the door slowly opening. These events have been witnessed for decades, and by countless numbers of people and as before stated even exists on video. The building is currently open\u00a0 as a museum for historical tours Tuesday thru Friday for a small admission fee, and plans are in the works to do a half night paranormal tour for Halloween 2008.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.19", "year": "2008", "moon_upper_transit": "03:47  DT", "city_latitude": "37.990079", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:45  DT", "resident_population": "4041769.0", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Kentucky", "state_abbrev": "KY", "binge drinking (%)": "15.8", "resident_population_density_rank": "25.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.7", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "9.7", "simple assault": "236.0", "latitude_y": "38.1868", "latitude_x": "37.9898694", "under 21 death percentage": "2.67", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:41  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "3195000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "08:44  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "14", "median drinks per binge": "5.7", "longitude": "-84.1784381", "curphase": "Waning Gibbous", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "21:06  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_longitude": "-84.17965029999999", "quarter": "4", "chronic death percentage": "53.5", "rape/sexual assault": "21.0", "robbery": "47.0"}
