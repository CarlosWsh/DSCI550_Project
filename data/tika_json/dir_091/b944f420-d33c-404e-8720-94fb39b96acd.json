The house burned down mysteriously and only the fireplace and chimney are left standing. There have been several occurrences of smoke seen coming out of the chimney. If you go about 2 miles down the road, where the road ends at the bridge, there are 10 or 12 separate piles, one of old toys, one of old clothes, one ceiling tiles, one wood, one glass, and several more that you can't see anymore because they have all been burnt to ash. There are things hanging from the trees and animals with heads missing have been seen out there as well. Witnesses report even seeing the different piles smoldering at times. Legend has it the witch died in a fire and her soul still burns anything that is near her property with a vengeance. Even the few scattered houses out there have scorch marks on the roofs. Driving out there, cars tend to not start, headlights often go off, and there is an incredibly eerie feeling surrounding the whole area as if someone is watching you. You can also hear footsteps following directly behind you if you are VERY quiet and when you turn around, there is nothing.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.36", "longitude_y": "-97.5164", "aggravated assault": "", "city_latitude": "35.4675602", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:45  ST", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "OK", "sun_upper_transit": "12:31  ST", "state_abbrev": "OK", "number_of_tribes": "86.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "85.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "35.4676", "latitude_x": "35.3507023", "under 21 death percentage": "2.76", "usgs_region": "Southwest", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Oklahoma", "taxpayer cost": "3081000000.0", "hp_day": "1863/07/01", "moonset": "23:03  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "7", "median drinks per binge": "5.6", "longitude": "-97.4208984", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "binge drinking (%)": "13.6", "sunset": "19:48  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.5", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "16.257088846880908", "city_longitude": "-97.5164276", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "58.7", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
