This spirit seems to be very hostile. Reported by people walking by the tracks that have no knowledge of the \"legend\" and hear distinct whispering (one such incident, the entity whispered \"I see you\") as well as feeling strange rushes of air, as if someone is running past them. Cold spots , the feeling of not being welcomed are also felt. Those that have seen this entity describe it as a male, between the ages of 18-22, that is dressed in garments from the late 40's/early 50's. The spirit seems very territorial, and resides in a small area between/in a small gap in between 2 buildings and a moveable dumpster about 20\" to the right of the gap. \"He\" (by those that have seen him) generally appears to be a full-body apparition and stays stationary until \"his space\" is disturbed. He tends to show is dislike by slamming the lid of the dumpster. 1 witness reports, \"It was completely `pen (folded along the back of the dumpster). As we all turned our backs to the dumpster, the lid slammed closed with incredible force. There was absolutely no wind and no one in the area besides us. Whoever this spirit is, he does not take kindly to strangers.\"", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.29", "year": "1940", "moon_upper_transit": "01:22  ST", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "16.824196597353495", "state_abbrev": "CA", "city_latitude": "33.7174708", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:10  ST", "resident_population": "6907387.0", "state_y": "CA", "state_x": "California", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "binge drinking (%)": "16.6", "resident_population_density_rank": "30.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "21.7", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:08  ST", "latitude_x": "", "under 21 death percentage": "2.49", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "usgs_region": "Pacific", "quarter": "4", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "35011000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "06:36  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "1", "location": "LaVeta Train tracks", "longitude": "", "time_of_day": "Morning", "number_of_tribes": "89.0", "sunset": "19:34  ST", "robbery": "", "hp_day": "1940/12/31", "city_longitude": "-117.8311428", "curphase": "Waning Gibbous", "chronic death percentage": "64.4", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
