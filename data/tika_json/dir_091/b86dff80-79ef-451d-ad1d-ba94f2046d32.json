No one knows if the graves belong to confederate or union soldiers. Those are the graves of 3 adults and a child, along with the Adams family members; all marked. -  Driving down the road you can hear moaning and see things moving in the woods but when you reach the grave yard you hear nothing and see nothing except the graves. If you sit in your car for a while you can see people enter the graveyard and hear them talking. then they disappear and you hear and see nothing again. - December 2003 additional information - this area is patrolled by the police and you will be arrested for trespassing.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.86", "longitude_y": "-84.388", "aggravated assault": "", "city_latitude": "31.5785074", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:58  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Georgia", "state_abbrev": "GA", "binge drinking (%)": "15.1", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.6", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "69.3", "latitude_x": "31.6010788", "under 21 death percentage": "3.67", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:39  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "6931000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "17:00  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "3953.0", "witness_count": "4", "median drinks per binge": "5.3", "longitude": "-84.1107593", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:51  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_longitude": "-84.15574099999999", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "55.3", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
