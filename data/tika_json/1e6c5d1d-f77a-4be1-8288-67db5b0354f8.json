When you look outside, you here it, but you can't see it. Go Back in and wait a few minutes, then go out. You will see people fighting and drawing swords, shooting with cannons and guns. If you talk, move sudden, or run, there will be creatures running after you, they look human, but they have bloody teeth, cuts on their throat, crawl fast, and say in lowly, old voice, \"I lost, But I'll Get You For It!!\" Many people have reported this sighting and some have been severely injured. They act as if they are protecting something, or someone, form you. The people are unknown, but.....the war is somehow, familiar.
