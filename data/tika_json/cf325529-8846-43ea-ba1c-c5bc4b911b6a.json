A Lieutenant for the department whose actual name was Robert Lee would come by the new fire house everyday and take pictures of the progress of the new station. In March of 1990 Lee suffered a fatal heart attack while battling a structure fire. It has been said that Lee has been seen and heard throughout the new station. Many members have experienced this and can testify to the same. Many members believe Lee is there to watch over his fellow firefighters. Due to the name of this individual being the same as the famous Civil War General, the actual death and membership can be confirmed at the Cowpens Fire Department Website on the Memorial Page at - www.cowpensfire.com", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.88", "year": "1990", "moon_upper_transit": "12:16  DT", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.1890359168241966", "state_abbrev": "SC", "city_latitude": "35.0167918", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:44  DT", "resident_population": "3486703.0", "state_y": "SC", "state_x": "South Carolina", "median drinks per binge": "5.7", "number_of_tribes": "1.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "22.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "82.7", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "11.7", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "70.8", "latitude_x": "35.0228902", "resident_population_density": "116.0", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "usgs_region": "Southeast", "sun_upper_transit": "13:26  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "3983000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "19:55  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "2586.0", "witness_count": "1", "location": "Fire Department", "longitude": "-81.8025806", "time_of_day": "Morning", "binge drinking (%)": "16.3", "sunset": "20:39  DT", "robbery": "", "hp_day": "1990/03/01", "city_longitude": "-81.8039916", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "54.5", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
