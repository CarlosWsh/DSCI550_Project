No one was inside as far as we could see. the place was locked solid. No windows were busted out. Another witness said that he and a friend walked by the building. It was getting dark, and they were walking by. They heard walking inside. They went to investigate & it was locked up. No way any one got in. then a strange glow was seen in the corner. It floated.
