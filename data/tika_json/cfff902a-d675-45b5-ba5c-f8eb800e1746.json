It seemed as though he was bleeding from his head, and he began crying, \"Teacher! Teacher! I fell off the merry-go-round!\" Then he disappears.

I fell off the merry-go-round!\" Some years later, several parents complained about the safety of the merry-go-round and it was eventually taken off of the playground.
