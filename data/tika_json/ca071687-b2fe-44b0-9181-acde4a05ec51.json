One night a guy and a girl went out there, and while the girl was setting up the tent, the guy went back to the car to get something, and when he got to the car, the girl's head was resting on the hood of the car. So he ran to a nearby farmer's house and called the police, and when the police got to the car, the guy's body was dead next to it. Since then the name was been changed to Blood Town Forest for obvious reasons. You can hear all kinds of messed up things if you go out there, but be careful if you do because farmers that live nearby try to chase kids away from going in the forest. There is a big rock at the entrance that tells the entire story. A few kids have said that they have seen stuff out there.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.13", "moon_upper_transit": "08:52  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.7561436672967864", "city_latitude": "43.660975", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:18  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "ME", "state_x": "Maine", "state_abbrev": "ME", "binge drinking (%)": "19.5", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "88.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "68.5", "latitude_x": "", "under 21 death percentage": "1.68", "usgs_region": "Northwest", "sun_upper_transit": "12:41  DT", "city_sunrise": "4:57 am", "taxpayer cost": "938700000.0", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "moonset": "16:25  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "4", "median drinks per binge": "5.4", "longitude": "", "latitude_y": "44.307", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "4.0", "sunset": "20:27  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-70.26090649999999", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "61.5", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
