When an acolyte to the Episcopal priesthood attended this seminary, his wife had an affair with the Dean. To accommodate this affair, the woman hanged her husband; it was ruled a suicide, however. Since committing suicide is a mortal sin, the acolyte was buried in a cornfield rather than the cemetery. On her deathbed, the cheating wife confessed to her crime. The seminary wished to rightfully bury the body, so they exhumed the casket only to find that it was empty. It is said that the acolyte still haunts the grounds trying to get justice.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.19", "longitude_y": "-89.4012", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "1.890359168241966", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:43  DT", "city_latitude": "43.060842", "state_y": "WI", "state_x": "Wisconsin", "state_abbrev": "WI", "binge drinking (%)": "25.8", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "68.4", "latitude_x": "43.081003", "under 21 death percentage": "2.3", "usgs_region": "Midwest", "sun_upper_transit": "13:00  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "4453000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:44  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "2651.0", "witness_count": "1", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "longitude": "-88.422389", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "10.0", "sunset": "20:41  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.7", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-88.4037079", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "63.2", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
