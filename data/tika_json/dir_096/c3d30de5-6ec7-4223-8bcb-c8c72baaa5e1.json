You can hear people talking. Papers get thrown all over the floor. The lights go on after being turned off. Two people were seen running out of the bank chasing after some people walking down the street, even though the doors were shut and locked. A dog can be heard barking inside the bank.

Loud noises can be heard like there's a room full of people talking and then is gets really silent. A man was seen walking inside the bank and then just disappeared. The bottom of the elevator always glows bright red and doesn\u2019t work right.
