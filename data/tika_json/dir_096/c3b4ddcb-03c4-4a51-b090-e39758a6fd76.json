Most of the time they were fake and nothing happened. But once a young boy was having an exorcism and nothing happened he was still doing all sorts of impossible things. One day after the priests performed this exorcism each priest died a horrible death. A train hit one in a car crash, another in a house fire and the third. After all of the priests died the boy next died. It is said today that every Friday night you will see the boy walking around out side the school. And every full moon it is said that the priests try to cast out the spirits of the young boy once again.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.51", "longitude_y": "-89.644", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "11113976.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:58  DT", "city_latitude": "42.263079", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Illinois", "median drinks per binge": "5.7", "binge drinking (%)": "20.5", "resident_population_density_rank": "12.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "82.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "10.2", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:00  DT", "latitude_x": "42.2714155", "under 21 death percentage": "3.48", "usgs_region": "", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "9716000000.0", "hp_day": "1979/03/07", "moonset": "17:47  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "5151.0", "witness_count": "3", "state_abbrev": "IL", "longitude": "-87.9873514", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:30  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-88.00396529999999", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "57.4", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
