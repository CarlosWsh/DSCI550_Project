No one knows exactly why it closed. Apparently, there is a group of Satanists who work up there. It is believed that when people do sacrifices or something, bad energy is contained in the area. Anyway, several people have gone up the hill and have told me that there is a spot that has a bunch of rocks placed in a circle in the center is a pile of animal bones, but when the people went back up to find that place again, its always gone, and they will go up several times in search of it. Anyway old OIT had a dorm two school buildings and a gym that had a small swimming pool. There is one wall left, and a small area that has three walls and a cement floor. They are maybe 50 feet apart. Anyway, several people, credible witnesses say that they have seen apparitions, sometimes a fog in those two areas. Also if you go at night, you can hear sounds like people chanting, or footsteps if you sit in car with the lights off right next to those two buildings. Also just up the road from old OIT there is a hill, or at least what appears to be one. It\u2019s a small vortex. One of the urban legends is that an old Indian was hung from a tree on that hill right next to the road. If you park under the tree, he will push you up the hill. But there are so many of those stories in various states that it is doubtful. - April 2007 Update - It's fenced in. There are a series of large poles, possibly 30 feet high, with three giant tires hanging from them. No one knows for sure how they got the tires up there. Contrary to the page's entry, there are two buildings there. One is in okay condition, and there appears to be bloodstains on the side of it. On the other side of the place, there is a building in shambles, and this is what makes the place truly scary.
