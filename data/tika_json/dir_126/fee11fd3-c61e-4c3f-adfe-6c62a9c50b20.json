He was immediately taken to the nurse's office where he died. As he was dying, he expressed his desire to get back to school. Legend says that if you knock on the nurse's door, he will knock back or you will hear him walking in the room. Sometimes he will want you to play with him on the playground, but if you refuse, he will pick on you. We hopped the fence and searched for the office. When we found it, we knocked, only to hear a very loud shuffling sound emanate from the room. Whether it was a ghost or custodian, we didn't care. We booked it back to the car and took a quick picture in front of the school sign that read, \" Welcome to Mariposa Elementary, Where All Our Children Grow.\" - The police will be called if the neighbors see trespassers.-", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.29", "year": "2004", "longitude_y": "-121.478851", "aggravated assault": "72.0", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "16.824196597353495", "city_latitude": "34.0555693", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:10  DT", "resident_population": "33871648.0", "state_y": "CA", "state_x": "California", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "binge drinking (%)": "16.6", "resident_population_density_rank": "14.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "13.8", "simple assault": "229.0", "male death percentage": "69.1", "latitude_x": "34.023025", "under 21 death percentage": "2.49", "usgs_region": "Pacific", "sun_upper_transit": "13:08  DT", "city_sunrise": "4:53 am", "taxpayer cost": "35011000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "23:45  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "1", "state_abbrev": "CA", "longitude": "-117.1334609", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "time_of_day": "Morning", "number_of_tribes": "89.0", "sunset": "20:34  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "hp_day": "2004/09/20", "city_longitude": "-117.1825381", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "64.4", "rape/sexual assault": "21.0", "robbery": "42.0"}
