Legend has it he fell off one of the catwalks while working. Now his spirit haunts the theater. Lights switch on and off during presentations done for students, seats pull down and come up when no one is sitting next to you, and if alone in the theater practicing for a show, \"George\" loves to play lighting tricks on you. Fact is no one has ever died in that theatre. No Janitors are ever allowed to go up there nor do they have reason too. The history however, behind George is he has been ever present since the has been built. No one really knows where he comes from or what the history of the land is or anything...though there is a basic story that does float around. So far our George has three figures...The first being there was the business like man figure that was standing up against the wall. The second time George appeared, it was to the actors - [techs never saw him that night] however actors kept complaining about a little boy running around backstage trying to catch his toy ball. The last sighting that has happened was about a year ago witnessed by 2 people who where alone in the building. It was of a very large man and he sat down and filled up the aisle of the house ...which is about 2 and 1/2 to 3 feet wide. A week later after seeing this one of the witnesses was in the lighting booth. and reports, \u201dMy friend and I were coming down the stairs of the lighting booth to go talk to our teacher, who was at the other end of the building...no where near the stage or house [where the audience sits], as we got half way down the whole booth started shaking violently. Us thinking it was an earthquake ran and got the heck out of there. We went to our teachers office, which is located in the same building, and asked her if she felt an earthquake or anything. She looked at us and said, \"No, what are you talking about?\" Since then...George has managed to become more violent here and there...he never harms anyone...however he still continues to play his usual tricks.\u201d", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.29", "moon_upper_transit": "16:12  DT", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "16.824196597353495", "state_abbrev": "CA", "city_latitude": "37.3382082", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:10  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "CA", "state_x": "California", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "number_of_tribes": "89.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "307.0", "sun_upper_transit": "13:08  DT", "latitude_x": "37.3677202", "under 21 death percentage": "2.49", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "usgs_region": "Pacific", "quarter": "2", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "35011000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "23:36  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "2", "location": "Independence High School", "longitude": "-121.8574547", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "16.6", "sunset": "20:34  DT", "robbery": "56.0", "hp_day": "2023/06/17", "city_longitude": "-121.8863286", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "64.4", "rape/sexual assault": "43.0"}
