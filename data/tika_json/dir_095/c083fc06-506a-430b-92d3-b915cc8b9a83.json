It is said that at one time there was a fire started by a coal burning stove in which the Superintendent(who smoked cigars) died in along with a young school boy. When the people that turned the old school into the bed and breakfast begin tearing down things that needed repair things started happening such as objects vanishing and moaning. Lights flickering on and off and a light would turn on in the cellar that when you used the switch to turn it off it would not go off. Also when working one day the smelled cigar smoke, neither of them being smokers went to see what it was. In the cellar there was smoke in the air, cigar smoke coming from a cigar that was still hot. Once they started putting things back things gradually got better. Witnesses report feelings of being watched and there's cold spots and sometimes the hair stands up on the back of your neck.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "1.89", "year": "1800", "longitude_y": "-100.7837", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.7561436672967864", "city_latitude": "47.8825008", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:08  ST", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "ND", "state_x": "North Dakota", "state_abbrev": "ND", "number_of_tribes": "4.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "82.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "70.3", "latitude_x": "47.8908538", "resident_population_density": "", "usgs_region": "Midwest", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "487600000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "20:51  ST", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "347.0", "witness_count": "2", "latitude_y": "46.8208", "longitude": "-100.1357734", "time_of_day": "Morning", "binge drinking (%)": "22.7", "sunset": "20:41  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "1800/03/01", "city_longitude": "-100.241246", "curphase": "New Moon", "chronic death percentage": "62.2", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
