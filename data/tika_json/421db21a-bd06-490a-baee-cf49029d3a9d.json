According to legend, it once was a popular meeting place of witches. The Snake River is also in the vicinity and supposedly draws wicca ceremonies due to the fact that it flows south-to-north. Near the Butte (and in the outlying areas, as well) many people have spotted small, shadow-like creatures after dark. A witness claims she was chased to her car by something she couldn't see very well. Whatever it was made noises and was about the size of a dog. Even though she doesn't spook easily, she was terrified by the incident. A few years prior, another witness claimed to have seen a similar creature at a nearby park one night. Other sightings have occurred. In addition to these alleged 'imps' the entire area surrounding Malheur Butte emanates a creepy vibe that is unmistakable.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.81", "year": "1960", "moon_upper_transit": "10:25  ST", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "1.1342155009451798", "state_abbrev": "OR", "city_latitude": "44.0265525", "begin_civil_twilight": "03:48  ST", "resident_population": "1768687.0", "state_y": "OR", "sun_upper_transit": "12:14  ST", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "binge drinking (%)": "17.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "40.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "89.3", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "16.3", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "68.1", "latitude_x": "44.0109959", "resident_population_density": "18.4", "median binges monthly": "1.7", "usgs_region": "Northwest", "quarter": "3", "city_sunrise": "4:55 am", "state_x": "Oregon", "taxpayer cost": "3520000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "17:49  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "2", "location": "Malheur Butte", "longitude": "-117.0851668", "latitude_y": "44.9429", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "6.0", "sunset": "20:02  ST", "robbery": "", "hp_day": "1960/07/03", "city_longitude": "-116.9629378", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "68.3", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
