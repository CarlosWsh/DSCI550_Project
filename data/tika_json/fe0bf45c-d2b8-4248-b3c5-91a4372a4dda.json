In one of the rooms the light in the bathroom will flicker on and off throughout the night (the switch is sideways, making a loud clicking noise). In another room a specter plays with the visitors belongings. It likes to use their credit cards, money, and driver's license to play a game of poker under the bed. In the last room during the hours of 12 and 2:30 a foul smell is present in the room, which is said to be the same spirit that likes to play with the lights and belongings. There was also a case where a mysterious man wearing all green and a cap that concealed all of his face except for his red beard. He was working in the office in the early morning hours; the next day it was discovered that no men were employed at this motel, yet he had a set of keys and checked in customers. There were no other employees at the establishment at the time.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.69", "moon_upper_transit": "09:48  DT", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "06:02  DT", "city_latitude": "32.4487364", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Texas", "median drinks per binge": "5.6", "binge drinking (%)": "17.6", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.9", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "30.2672", "latitude_x": "32.4915166", "resident_population_density": "", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:33  DT", "city_sunrise": "5:44 am", "taxpayer cost": "18821000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:49  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "4", "state_abbrev": "TX", "longitude": "-99.7476449", "time_of_day": "Morning", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:36  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-99.73314390000002", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "56.9", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
