After hours, custodians and other faculty report seeing him walk around the halls, apparently looking for troublemakers - as he would do normally as principal. They also have reported doors shutting, lights turning off, voices, and other noises, all of which have no explanations. This school, reportedly, is one of the most haunted in all of northern Virginia. In 1995, a teacher even reported hearing a moaning and screaming down the hallways, with no one else around.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.78", "longitude_y": "-77.436", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.1890359168241966", "resident_population": "3966949.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:17  ST", "city_latitude": "38.88233400000001", "state_y": "VA", "state_x": "Virginia", "state_abbrev": "VA", "binge drinking (%)": "16.4", "resident_population_density_rank": "16.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "19.5", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "37.5407", "latitude_x": "38.9096183", "under 21 death percentage": "3.09", "usgs_region": "Northeast", "sun_upper_transit": "12:11  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "6126000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "17:23  ST", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "2", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "longitude": "-77.17461469999999", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "1.0", "sunset": "19:34  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "hp_day": "1960/01/01", "city_longitude": "-77.1710914", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "57.1", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
