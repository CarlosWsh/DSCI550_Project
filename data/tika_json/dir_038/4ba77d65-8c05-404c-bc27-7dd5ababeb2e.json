(now called the AON building) - The building on Wilshire burned down on may 4, 1988. An engineer was riding the elevator when the doors opened on the 12th floor, the place where the fire was taking place. When they found his body it was shriveled and burnt. Janitors have reported hearing noises and lights switching on and off on the eleventh floor as well as the 32nd floor. Also, a couple of people committed suicide by jumping off the top. One man jumped 'cause his wife left him. Another lady a couple of years back, in the 90's. Her intestines were hanging off the trees.
