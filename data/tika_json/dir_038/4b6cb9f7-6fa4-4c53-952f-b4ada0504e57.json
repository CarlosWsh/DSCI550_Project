The modern name, \u201cDump Road\u201d was given because of the trash dumped illegally up on the mountain by local people. This trail was traveled on by early settlers in the 1800's. The road is above the unmarked neighborhood called, \u201cBrownwood Estates\u201d. Originally, a paved section was completed going up the hill to the old road. It was supposed to be an expansion of the subdivision but was never completed in the 1980's. It hasn't been confirmed, but it\u2019s rumored that the contractor responsible for developing the neighborhood had a bad experience on the old road, and never completed the subdivision. There are power poles set, but no lines. Since then, it is frequented by teens looking to park at night, camp, or for off-road vehicles. Many sightin gs during the day and night have included horses and wagons making their way along the old trail. Some people have claimed to see what appeared to be a black slave hanging from a tree above a clay embankment on the road, which is now used illegally as a shooting range. In the late 1980's, a couple that lived in the neighborhood below hiked into the mountain and discovered what was later found to be an old slave house near where a plantation burned in the early 1900's. Some reports from campers have claimed that while sleeping at night, they suddenly felt a very heavy presence and were woken by blood curdling screams in the forest. More reports suggest the sounds of screams and horses hurrying down the trail with an angry mob. Also reported are sightings of torches and lanterns bouncing around on the trail. It is believed that this is the event leading to the slave being hung. Residents in the neighborhood nearby have reported seeing a man walking up and down the street at ni ght, disappearing into the woods leading to the mountain.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.06", "location": "Dump Road", "moon_upper_transit": "16:19  ST", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.945179584120983", "city_latitude": "33.8137125", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:09  ST", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "AL", "state_x": "Alabama", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "number_of_tribes": "5.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "79.9", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "71.5", "latitude_x": "33.8977536", "resident_population_density": "", "usgs_region": "Southeast", "sun_upper_transit": "11:46  ST", "city_sunrise": "5:32 am", "taxpayer cost": "3724000000.0", "hp_day": "1700/12/31", "moonset": "22:52  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "2", "state_abbrev": "AL", "longitude": "-85.6752303", "latitude_y": "32.377", "time_of_day": "Morning", "binge drinking (%)": "13.6", "sunset": "18:55  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.7", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-85.76135359999999", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "49.8", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
