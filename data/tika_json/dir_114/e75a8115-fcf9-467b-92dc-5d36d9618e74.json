Multiple people, both employees and customers have seen him. He stands near a small fountain, but appears to be standing on a surface below the shop's floor, as he comes out of the ground at the knees. He only appears briefly then is gone, and those who have seen him say he is benevolent. The store is very close to the Bath House, so it is possible that the two are somehow connected.
