The most frightening of these occurrences happened after the bar closed one night in 2003. The bar manager (my husband)was alone in the building, cleaning the bar area. He turned on the TV to a hard-rock music channel to help keep him motivated and awake. The TV channel suddenly turned to a non-music channel. The bar manager, not yet frightened, turned the channel back to the music channel. Again, the channel changed to a non-music channel. The bar manager, says out loud \"I can get out of here much faster if you let me listen to my music channel\".
