Built in the mid 1800's, Charlie Harden, a wealthy man, had this house built where he later died. There have been more than a few sightings of the ghost of Mr. Harden in the ornate foyer, and on the curving stair case connecting to it. Cold spots abound in the house even though extensive work to the work house was completed. The sounds of someone walking on the long curving stairs and landing are often heard mainly in the late afternoon. Children who have lived in the house tell stories of the nocturnal knockings on bedroom doors and walls, and of the bad dreams that accompany them.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.08", "year": "1800", "longitude_y": "-73.7562", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "1.1342155009451798", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "03:41  ST", "city_latitude": "43.33873639999999", "state_y": "NY", "state_x": "New York", "median drinks per binge": "5.4", "number_of_tribes": "6.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.4", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "67.2", "latitude_x": "", "under 21 death percentage": "2.03", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "usgs_region": "Northwest", "sun_upper_transit": "11:56  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "16330000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "19:37  ST", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "4", "state_abbrev": "NY", "longitude": "", "time_of_day": "Afternoon", "binge drinking (%)": "17.6", "sunset": "19:36  ST", "robbery": "", "hp_day": "1800/06/01", "city_longitude": "-75.78365889999999", "curphase": "New Moon", "chronic death percentage": "63.3", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
