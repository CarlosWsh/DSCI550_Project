A little girl who fell off the back of the 1st module (at Stage left). This ghost has been encountered by many late night drama students during long hours of rehearsal. She has been said the sing \"I dropped my dolly in the dirt\" but is never actually SEEN. 2. An older drama graduate who went off to become a model in 1973. \"Sally,\" as they call her, was a perfectionist and didn't think she would make it & committed suicide. There has been 2 witnesses of \"Sally\", but she is always seen backstage and only her profile is seen. Doors have locked, and on one account, a student was actually trapped within the room by this unknown force. Things have been known to move and scratches and whispers have been heard. Many of the Drama students believe that it's \"Sally\" trying to make herself known once and for all.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.36", "longitude_y": "-97.5164", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "16.257088846880908", "city_latitude": "34.8611959", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:45  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "OK", "state_x": "Oklahoma", "state_abbrev": "OK", "number_of_tribes": "86.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "85.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "68.6", "latitude_x": "34.8615999", "resident_population_density": "", "median binges monthly": "1.5", "usgs_region": "Southwest", "sun_upper_transit": "13:32  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "3081000000.0", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "moonset": "16:59  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "2", "median drinks per binge": "5.6", "longitude": "-96.6654503", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "13.6", "sunset": "20:49  DT", "robbery": "", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-96.6655688", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "58.7", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
