One is a male entity that has been known to be seen in the bathroom. He also is known for playing with people's music selections and breaking windows. It is said that a young man killed himself by jumping off of the balcony back in the 70's when the hall was new. The other Homer four ghost is a woman who has been seen in a few of the rooms. She turns on faucets in the girls bathroom, and reportedly blood has been randomly seen there late at night in the shower stalls. On the ground floor lounge, students claim the VCR and Television sometimes work on their own will, and also visible shadows move about the room. Homer two is the home of the ghost of an old man who wanders the halls at all times of the day. An angry entity haunts the ground floor of Nickerson Hall. When walking through the underground passage between Homer and Nickerson, students can hear something banging on the metal doors in one of the storage rooms. The poltergeist has been known to move about the ground floor of Nickerson on occasion.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.46", "longitude_y": "-71.4222", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.1890359168241966", "city_latitude": "41.8239891", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:37  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "RI", "state_x": "Rhode Island", "state_abbrev": "RI", "number_of_tribes": "1.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "87.4", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:48  DT", "latitude_x": "41.8259947", "under 21 death percentage": "1.42", "usgs_region": "Northwest", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "4:47 am", "taxpayer cost": "886500000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:25  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "2", "latitude_y": "41.8236", "longitude": "-71.4074596", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "17.8", "sunset": "20:24  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-71.4128343", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "59.8", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
