His spirit has been spotted on several occasions. A beginning actor was alone one night, and spotted a man sitting in a chair, smoking a pipe. He later told a seasoned actor and friend of his, who brought him to a picture of Ralph, asking him if that was the man he saw. He promptly said yes. Another actor reports during a dress rehearsal where they did absolutely no technical things whatsoever, the cast was on stage when suddenly Greensleeves began to play out of nowhere. They ran up to the soundbooth, which was empty, and tried to turn the CD player off. Before they could, the song changed right before their eyes! Others have witnessed in the costume attic by the light of the \"Ghost Light\" which is left on every night since the first sighting.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.81", "year": "1994", "moon_upper_transit": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "1.1342155009451798", "state_abbrev": "OR", "city_latitude": "42.224867", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:48  DT", "resident_population": "2842321.0", "state_y": "OR", "sunrise": "05:26  DT", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "binge drinking (%)": "17.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "42.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "89.3", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "7.9", "simple assault": "692.0", "sun_upper_transit": "13:14  DT", "latitude_x": "42.2221796", "resident_population_density": "29.6", "usgs_region": "Northwest", "curphase": "Waxing Gibbous", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Oregon", "taxpayer cost": "3520000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "03:50  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "2", "location": "Linkville Playhouse", "longitude": "-121.785659", "latitude_y": "44.9429", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "6.0", "sunset": "21:02  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.7", "hp_day": "1994/07/31", "city_longitude": "-121.7816704", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "68.3", "rape/sexual assault": "55.0", "robbery": "124.0"}
