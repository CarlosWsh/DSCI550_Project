When there the wife kept telling Ernie that she was unhappy there and to secluded. Ernie made no attempt to move or find another job. So one day his wife took off with a Block Island Ferry Capt. Because of his wife\u2019s leaving, Ernie became so depressed that he slit his throat and then jumped to the waters below from the top of the light house. Stories have it that Ernie now haunts the lighthouse. The lighthouse was turned over to the coast guard who manned it, and cadets have reported the opening and closing of doors, the decks being swabbed when they weren't the ones who did it. The lighthouse is now unmanned and run on a timer for when the light goes on and off. Project Oceanology of Groton has summer tours out to the lighthouse, but this is the only way anyone will be able to go there.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.75", "year": "1912", "moon_upper_transit": "17:59  ST", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.1890359168241966", "city_latitude": "41.3497456", "begin_civil_twilight": "03:41  ST", "resident_population": "1114756.0", "state_y": "CT", "sun_upper_transit": "11:52  ST", "state_abbrev": "CT", "binge drinking (%)": "18.7", "resident_population_density_rank": "6.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "84.9", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "22.7", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "68.2", "latitude_x": "41.3058456", "resident_population_density": "230.2", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "usgs_region": "Northeast", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "city_sunrise": "4:50 am", "state_x": "Connecticut", "taxpayer cost": "3029000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "1426.0", "witness_count": "1", "latitude_y": "41.764", "longitude": "-72.077439", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "1.0", "sunset": "19:29  ST", "robbery": "", "hp_day": "1912/07/31", "city_longitude": "-72.0790717", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "55.2", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
