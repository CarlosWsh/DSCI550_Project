The sub-basement goes down another four floors and is nicknamed \"the dungeon\". It was said that when workers were laying the cement for the sub-basement a co-worker went mysteriously missing, his lunch and house keys were found but he wasn't. It was assumed that when laying the cement floor he must have fallen in and no one saw it happen. People who are new to the building are told about this ghost and the name given to him, \"Jason.\" (for no real reason)To this day there have been many reports from people who travel down there for old documents and books. He will travel with you up the old steel elevators and you will get chills that will go all over your body. It feels like you have walked into a cold spot. And as soon as the chills start they will stop again. He will turn on the lights after they have been turned off (maybe to read so old books). He has also been known to help people look for books that they can't find. Books will mysteriously fall off of shelves and it will be the book that you were looking for. People say that they can feel him watching them work when they work down in \"the dungeon\". Many people have seen him out of the corner of their eye, but as soon as you turn your head to look at him he's gone again. He's also scared a few people enough to never want to go down there alone or again but he has never harmed anyone. He's become a part of everyday life with all of the people who work in the sub-basement.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.08", "longitude_y": "-73.7562", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "1.1342155009451798", "state_abbrev": "NY", "city_latitude": "42.6525793", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:42  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "NY", "state_x": "New York", "median drinks per binge": "5.4", "number_of_tribes": "6.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.4", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:57  DT", "latitude_x": "42.6538226", "under 21 death percentage": "2.03", "usgs_region": "Northwest", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "16330000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:37  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "1", "latitude_y": "42.6526", "longitude": "-73.75730399999999", "time_of_day": "Afternoon", "binge drinking (%)": "17.6", "sunset": "20:37  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-73.7562317", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "63.3", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
