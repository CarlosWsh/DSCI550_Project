She is said to be a young woman who wears a gray suit in the style of the Civil War era. She walks through the cemetery with her head bowed and appears to be weeping. She has been seen walking directly through trees and through the iron cemetery gates. In the summer of 1988, during a Civil War re-enactment, many of the people present heard the sounds of a woman crying. There was no woman present but the weeping sounds were unmistakable. It was believed to have been Lady in Gray, still grieving over the loss of some forgotten soldier.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.84", "longitude_y": "-82.9988", "aggravated assault": "", "city_latitude": "39.9611755", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:31  DT", "resident_population": "10797630.0", "state_y": "", "sunrise": "06:03  DT", "state_abbrev": "OH", "binge drinking (%)": "17.2", "resident_population_density_rank": "11.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "1.4", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:34  DT", "latitude_x": "39.9438494", "resident_population_density": "264.3", "usgs_region": "", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "city_sunrise": "5:35 am", "state_x": "Ohio", "taxpayer cost": "8520000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "01:02  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "1", "latitude_y": "39.9612", "longitude": "-83.0759564", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "21:04  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_longitude": "-82.99879419999999", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "54.8", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
