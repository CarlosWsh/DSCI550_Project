Back over a hundred years ago before there was a school, there was a dirt road that ran through the school, but more precise through the auditorium. A kid named Mikey was walking on the street when a man driving a horse and buggy ran him down. the exact spot where Mikey was killed is where the auditorium is today. If you are in the auditorium you can sometimes see Mikey out of the corner of your eye run past the stage. You can also hear and see Mikey in the sound booth or up on the catwalk. Mikey has also been known to turn off the lights.
