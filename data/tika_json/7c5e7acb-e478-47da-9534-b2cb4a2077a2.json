Her spirit has been seen her spirit, hanging in her wedding dress. Also, African Americans were hung down the road. A lot of spirits dwell on this road. - February 2005 Correction - Formerly listed under - Poquoson - Crawford Rd - There have been other stories about the part of the road where the Tour Road crosses over Crawford Rd. There is a story that on some nights that you can see a black lady in a white dress walk up on the bridge onto the ledge, then she falls off and then she stops in mid air and swings like she was hung. There have also been stories of your car cutting out and not starting. If you drove down it at night you could see someone hanging from the bridge where someone was hung years ago and that cars have shut off underneath the bridge. - December 2006 additional information: Before you come to crybaby bridge that runs about halfway down from the roads entrance on either side of the vast woods lies a fenced off road that actually heads back into a clearing if you're daring enough to cross the threshold. If you enter the clearing, you will find a solitary building that is long since abandoned with no doors. If you watch, there are red eyes that may appear in one of the open doorways (most likely the very last door all the way to the right) 'watching' you as you move around. Should you get close they may end up vanishing before you can locate them. Going into the building itself, however, yields the very eerie feeling of more than one 'being' watching your every move. It has been seen on film of shadow people walking around along the walls without actually anything being in front of the light source (always in the shape of a tall male creeping along). There have also been reports of people feeling like they have had their feet stepped on, voices whispering, and even hands lain upon the middle of their backs. This experience is random, but best done on a clear, moonless night. But you never know what you might find if you actually go to the radio station once the sun is down.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.78", "longitude_y": "-77.436", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.1890359168241966", "city_latitude": "37.2387556", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:18  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "VA", "sunrise": "05:49  DT", "state_abbrev": "VA", "number_of_tribes": "1.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:12  DT", "latitude_x": "37.2107044", "under 21 death percentage": "3.09", "usgs_region": "Northeast", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Virginia", "taxpayer cost": "6126000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:39  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "3071.0", "witness_count": "1", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "longitude": "-76.53363379999999", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "16.4", "sunset": "20:34  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-76.5096731", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "57.1", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
