The girl has blond hair, blue eyes, and wears a pretty blue dress. She has been seen playing around in Water Works and scares tram drivers by playing hide-and-seek with them after the park is closed. She is thought to be buried in the cemetery that is located between the parking lot and the campgrounds which is on King's Island property. Another ghost haunted the observation deck of the Eiffel Tower. This ghost is thought to be the spirit of a young man who in a drunken stupor tried to climb the tower and fell to his death. It seems though that he has left. There is the ghost known as \"the Beast\" which haunts the roller coaster with the same name. Several guests have seen this ghost. There is a ghost that supposedly died on the ride \"the Octopus\". There are many other spirits that roam this Paramount theme park.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.84", "moon_upper_transit": "09:47  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_latitude": "39.1031182", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:31  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "", "sunrise": "06:04  DT", "state_abbrev": "OH", "binge drinking (%)": "17.2", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "39.9612", "latitude_x": "39.0547343", "under 21 death percentage": "2.63", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:34  DT", "city_sunrise": "5:41 am", "state_x": "Ohio", "taxpayer cost": "8520000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "17:09  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "7", "median drinks per binge": "5.7", "longitude": "-84.4186119", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "21:04  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-84.5120196", "quarter": "1", "chronic death percentage": "54.8", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
