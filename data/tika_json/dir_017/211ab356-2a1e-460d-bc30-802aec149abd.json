The building opened in the fall of 1962. The elevators only go up to the tenth floor; you have to take stairs from there to the eleventh floors. The eleventh floors are generally locked and used for storage. I believe people originally lived in them, although nobody has for years. The eleventh floor of Atkin has a presence in it. Nobody seems to know what could have caused a haunting up there, and I don't think a ghost has ever been sighted. But there seems to be a very strong negative presence. You can even feel it on the landing--outside that locked door. I know people who won't go up there alone at night.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.51", "longitude_y": "-89.644", "city_latitude": "40.5142026", "begin_civil_twilight": "03:58  ST", "resident_population": "10081158.0", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Illinois", "median drinks per binge": "5.7", "binge drinking (%)": "20.5", "resident_population_density_rank": "12.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "82.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "15.7", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "39.798", "latitude_x": "40.5122833", "resident_population_density": "181.6", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:00  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "9716000000.0", "hp_day": "1962/10/01", "moonset": "08:12  ST", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "5151.0", "witness_count": "", "state_abbrev": "IL", "longitude": "-88.9946702", "curphase": "Waning Gibbous", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "19:30  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_longitude": "-88.9906312", "quarter": "4", "chronic death percentage": "57.4", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
