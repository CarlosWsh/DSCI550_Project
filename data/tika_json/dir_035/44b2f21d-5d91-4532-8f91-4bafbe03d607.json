Now are said to be haunted by the men.- June 2005 Update/Additional Information \u2013 This is a rather infamous part of Portland as the name suggests. Men would be shanghaied, beaten up to awaken aboard a ship. Also, women would be kidnapped and sold into the sex business. This form of slavery is something that has been both remembered and forgotten (usually at the same time) by Portland natives alike. It is said that the spirit of \"NINA\" has been known to haunt the halls of the tunnels. The spirit has been seen as that of a woman in white, which matched the description of a girl named Nina who died in those tunnels. In fact, the apparition has been known to stay pretty close to where her name \"NINA\" has been carved into the brick in one of the passages there. It is an original carving that was put there back in the day.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.81", "longitude_y": "-123.0351", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "1.1342155009451798", "state_abbrev": "OR", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:48  DT", "city_latitude": "45.5230622", "state_y": "OR", "sunrise": "05:26  DT", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "binge drinking (%)": "17.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "89.3", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:14  DT", "latitude_x": "45.5242541", "resident_population_density": "", "usgs_region": "Northwest", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Oregon", "taxpayer cost": "3520000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "17:12  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "", "latitude_y": "44.9429", "longitude": "-122.6732813", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "6.0", "sunset": "21:02  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.7", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-122.6764815", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "68.3", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
