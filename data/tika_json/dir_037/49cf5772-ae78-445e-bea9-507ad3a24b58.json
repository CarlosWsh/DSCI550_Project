One maintenance man was going in the maintenance elevator in the back of the building when he heard people whispering very angrily at him. As a historical note I should tell you that Music Hall was built over a pauper's cemetery and in the 80's when they were renovating they found many graves. Anyway one worker was in the building at night by himself and he heard laughter coming from one of the ballrooms, when he investigated he saw several men and women dressed in 1800's clothing. This next event took place during the day and several women witnessed it. Several women were preparing for an event that was to be held there when they all heard a beautiful female voice. They searched the whole building but they found nothing. None of them felt threaten because the voice was so beautiful.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.84", "longitude_y": "-82.9988", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_latitude": "39.1031182", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:30  ST", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "", "sunrise": "05:03  ST", "state_abbrev": "OH", "binge drinking (%)": "17.2", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:33  ST", "latitude_x": "39.1093947", "under 21 death percentage": "2.63", "usgs_region": "", "quarter": "4", "city_sunrise": "5:41 am", "state_x": "Ohio", "taxpayer cost": "8520000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "08:57  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "7", "latitude_y": "39.9612", "longitude": "-84.51923099999999", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:04  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "hp_day": "1799/12/31", "city_longitude": "-84.5120196", "curphase": "Waning Gibbous", "chronic death percentage": "54.8", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
