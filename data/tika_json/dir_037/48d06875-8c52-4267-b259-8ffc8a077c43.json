Also, the old train conductor lantern moves up and down the tracks, but disappears when approached.

As far as the lights, it is well known and also documented in the local newspaper the \"Butler Eagle\" about the \"phantom train\" in the area. It seems that some locals have fun and set up train lights and whistles near the cross roads and turn them on as cars and people pass by to see who will stop or look out for the train.
