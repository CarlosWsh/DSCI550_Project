It's said that if you go into the house mysterious people run out, weird noises our heard like footsteps, doors slamming, windows breaking. - November 2003 Update: The house was built in the 40's. The whole area around it was a ranch, and that's where the family lived. The murders happened in the 60's or early 70's. There are two stories; the first being the family had a retarded son they kept in the cellar, but not abusively. He lived down there, had everything he need, bathroom, bed, television. There is a large walk in freezer down there too. Apparently he murdered his parents and kept the bodies in the freezer, and eventually died himself. The second story is that The kid that lived there wasn't retarded, and after his parents died of natural causes lived there. It's said he was a pedophile and a child murderer and would kill children and hide their bodies in the freezer. Right now it's zoned for commercial use, so companies keep buying the property with plans to level it and put a building there. About two or three weeks later, they'll sell it. Reports of a family who bought it and started to renovate it. New shingles, new windows, all the graphite on the outside is gone, but 3 weeks later, all work on the house stopped. Right now there is a fence around the property, and the road has been lowered, but you can still see it. - March 2007 Update: Burned down Summer 2006", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.69", "moon_upper_transit": "09:48  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_latitude": "32.735687", "begin_civil_twilight": "06:02  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Texas", "median drinks per binge": "5.6", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.9", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "30.2672", "latitude_x": "32.7078351", "resident_population_density": "", "usgs_region": "", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "5:33 am", "taxpayer cost": "18821000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:49  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "", "state_abbrev": "TX", "longitude": "-97.0644732", "time_of_day": "Morning", "binge drinking (%)": "17.6", "sunset": "20:36  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-97.1080656", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "56.9", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
