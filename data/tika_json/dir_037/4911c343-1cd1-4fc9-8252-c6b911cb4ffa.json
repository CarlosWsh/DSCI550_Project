The old mile and a half long road is a well-known urban legend in the area. An old barn is still present in the woods, and sounds can be heard at night.

Slaves have been seen wandering the road late at night.- May 2004 additional information: If you stop there and turn off your lights and put your car in neutral, you will begin to roll very slowly, at times it feels as though you are being rocked, very strange, Though it doesn't happen every time.
