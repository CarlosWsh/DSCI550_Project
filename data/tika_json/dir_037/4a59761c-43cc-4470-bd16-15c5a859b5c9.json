Numerous signs of ghosts can be detected here. A lady in white stands over one of the graves, and when approached she disappears. Footsteps in the grass can be heard either following, or coming towards you. Shadows and small white lights can be seen in the woods surrounding the cemetery. The most frightening area is definitely the Northwest corner of the cemetery underneath an Oak tree. This section contains the graves of children. It's the darkest section of the cemetery, and if you stand in the path right by these graves. Something will sound like it's falling out of the tree, and will hit the ground with a thud. There is never anything there.
