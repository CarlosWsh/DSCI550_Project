There were recent sightings by employees that a young boy was sighted in the empty hallways leading to the storage room. The time was around 12:00 am closing time. The employees, even a customer, saw a young male at the age around 7-10 walking slowly towards them, but from a distance. One of the employees claimed to see the young spirit sitting beside some crates with his head down, and his arms covering his knees. The customer simply believed that he saw someone standing on the corner at the end of the hallway facing against the wall. He wanted to use the nearby restroom before he saw the figure. All visions of his spirit were blurry because they said that there was lack of lighting inside the location. Rumors are that the building was once a motel in the mid 1900s until it was burnt down because the owner had money problems with local gang members; however, the presence of the young boy is still a mystery.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.29", "moon_upper_transit": "09:26  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "16.824196597353495", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:10  DT", "city_latitude": "37.7749295", "state_y": "CA", "state_x": "California", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "binge drinking (%)": "16.6", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:08  DT", "latitude_x": "37.7691755", "under 21 death percentage": "2.49", "usgs_region": "Pacific", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "35011000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:48  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "1", "state_abbrev": "CA", "longitude": "-122.4278748", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "89.0", "sunset": "20:34  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-122.4194155", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "64.4", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
