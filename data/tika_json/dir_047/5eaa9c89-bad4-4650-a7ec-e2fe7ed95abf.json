It's a bronze statue on the far north edge of the cemetery, kind of in the middle. It is in a gorgeous spot with palms and it is recessed into the woods a bit, with benches and such. All the graves in the cemetery are laid out with the feet facing East, this families graves are the only ones where the feet face west. A family erected the statue when there 5 year old son died and the bronze soon weathered to a black color that could not be cleaned. The Jesus is a classic pose with the hands out stretched and palms up, except sometime when you go out at night the hands are turned down!", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.69", "moon_upper_transit": "18:29  ST", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:02  ST", "city_latitude": "30.7235263", "state_y": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:32  ST", "state_abbrev": "TX", "binge drinking (%)": "17.6", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.9", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "30.2672", "latitude_x": "30.7271742", "under 21 death percentage": "3.97", "usgs_region": "", "quarter": "2", "city_sunrise": "4:51 am", "state_x": "Texas", "taxpayer cost": "18821000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "00:17  ST", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "10647.0", "witness_count": "1", "location": "Oakwood Cemetery", "longitude": "-95.5423701", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "19:35  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "1836/06/30", "city_longitude": "-95.5507771", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "56.9", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
