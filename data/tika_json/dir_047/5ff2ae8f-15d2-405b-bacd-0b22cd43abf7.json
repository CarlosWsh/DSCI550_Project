Due to unfortunate circumstances, Joe was killed in an automobile accident on his way to work. Apparently, Joe is still waiting to perform that number. Several sightings have occurred in the Crystal Pistol of a man who stands at the edge of the balcony and watched performances that are currently being put on. Orbs have been found in photographs taken inside the music hall. After closing, many employees will hear a man singing backstage even though there is nobody back there. Employees have also found props missing from the stage and later find the props next to the Railroad tracks, which run beside the theater.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.86", "longitude_y": "-84.388", "resident_population": "3943116.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:58  DT", "city_latitude": "33.8126059", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Georgia", "state_abbrev": "GA", "binge drinking (%)": "15.1", "resident_population_density_rank": "26.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.6", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "14.5", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "33.749", "latitude_x": "33.7705277", "under 21 death percentage": "3.67", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:39  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "6931000000.0", "hp_day": "1967/07/01", "moonset": "05:33  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "3953.0", "witness_count": "2", "location": "Six Flags Over Georgia", "longitude": "-84.55153700000001", "curphase": "Full Moon", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:51  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_longitude": "-84.6343783", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "55.3", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
