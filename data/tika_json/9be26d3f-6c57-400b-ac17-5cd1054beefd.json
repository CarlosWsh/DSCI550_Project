The Averill family managed the stagecoach stand on the site, hence the name Averill Stand, as well as the tavern and Inn. The family cemetery is on a small plot of land adjacent to the old pasture, and contains the bodies of many of the house's former occupants. One of those, Lavina Field Averill, is believed to have died in childbirth in the home, and it' is thought that she may be the spirit who has, several time, placed missing items on the kitchen counter. One visitor reports having seen a young woman in old clothing in the dining room. At night, always between 10:30 and 11:40, the current occupant's dogs run to the back door, barking, and watch someone or something, cross the back yard and walk to the old driveway. Some unseen being repeatedly rings the doorbell on snowy nights, leaving no trace of human footsteps. Perhaps it is Lavina, or perhaps it's Mrs. Brown, the wife of former lumber baron Martin Brown, who lived in the home for many years in the early 1900's, and died there. Mrs. Brown is known to visit at least one of the adjoining houses, in which she also resided. The house is noted for the repeated observations of spirit-sensitive folks for the warmth and friendliness and welcoming feel of the place, which many attribute to the spirits of the house.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.24", "moon_upper_transit": "17:19  ST", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_latitude": "42.8683889", "begin_civil_twilight": "03:29  ST", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Vermont", "state_abbrev": "VT", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "88.9", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "44.2624", "latitude_x": "", "resident_population_density": "", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "usgs_region": "", "quarter": "2", "city_sunrise": "5:05 am", "taxpayer cost": "513000000.0", "hp_day": "1787/06/17", "moonset": "23:15  ST", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "2", "location": "Averill Stand", "longitude": "", "time_of_day": "Morning", "binge drinking (%)": "18.5", "sunset": "19:37  ST", "robbery": "", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-72.8714468", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "68.7", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
