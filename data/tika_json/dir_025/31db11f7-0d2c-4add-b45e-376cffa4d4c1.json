It has long been said that where the street Shelly Drive ends into a new sub-division there was a horrible battle between Patriots and British troops. So Bloody and horrific was this Battle that scores of troops from both sides were killed. One particularly poor soul was that of a boy named William Champlain who fought on the side of the Patriots but was a spy for the British. When it was discovered by Washington's troops that Champlain was a spy they did not let on to him that he was compromised. At the start of the battle it was relayed to the troops by Washington himself that Champlain should be shot from behind to let the British know that his traitorous dealings didn't deserve a bullet from the firing squad. Upon the start of the Battle Champlain moved to the front of the line to get a better shot he was heard to say, and before the first volley of shots were exchanged between side's he was dropped in his stride from a volley of shot's from five patriot's. It has long been said that the spirit of William Champlain Haunt's the sub-division in search of Washington in the hopes of finding out why he was struck down by his own troops. Being only a boy of 17 at the time of his demise and fond of the flute he has been heard many a fall night playing sad ballads and tunes in search of his mentor. So if you are walking or driving down Shelly Drive one evening and see a young lad dressed in Colonial attire don't be alarmed it is only William Champlain looking for his troops bivouac, and the reason for his betrayal.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.3", "moon_upper_transit": "16:36  ST", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.1890359168241966", "city_latitude": "40.4120528", "begin_civil_twilight": "03:56  ST", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "NJ", "state_x": "New Jersey", "state_abbrev": "NJ", "number_of_tribes": "1.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "82.6", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "34.0", "latitude_x": "40.213983", "under 21 death percentage": "2.23", "usgs_region": "Northeast", "sun_upper_transit": "12:00  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "6175000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "23:22  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "1", "latitude_y": "40.2206", "longitude": "-74.06343799999999", "time_of_day": "Evening", "binge drinking (%)": "14.4", "sunset": "19:32  ST", "median binges monthly": "", "hp_day": "1776/06/19", "city_longitude": "-74.10319679999999", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "54.8", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
