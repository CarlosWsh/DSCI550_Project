He maintained his innocence and proclaimed that if he was executed, he would come back to haunt the town. After he was hung, his shadow could be seen on the side of the old jail, swinging back and forth. The jail was painted, to try to remove the shadow, but failed to. Ivy was allowed to grow on the side of the old jail, but years later when removed, the shadow was still visible. The old jail was torn down, but the business that were put on that site, failed and the roof of the building that was placed there, always peeled.
