The building is currently being restored by Ellusions, Inc. - www.ellusionsinc.com, who is currently renting it. Many employees have seen and heard many things in the building. When questioned, police officers who used to work there also verified unexplainable events. Ellusions had psychic Sandi Athey tour the building remotely. She described several events that were confirmed by previous tenants. Fort Wayne Ghost Trackers were asked to conduct an investigation, which also proved fruitful and confirmed many things posed by Psychic Sandi. The basement has documented cases of different smells and orbs and video of orbs were recorded by the staff of Ellusions and FWIGT.org. Rumor has it that the basement was once used as a temporary morgue. Orbs were photographed in many rooms throughout the building.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.65", "longitude_y": "-86.1581", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_latitude": "41.0706042", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:44  ST", "resident_population": "2700876.0", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Indiana", "state_abbrev": "IN", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "13.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.8", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "7.3", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "70.5", "latitude_x": "41.0795099", "under 21 death percentage": "3.41", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:46  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "4468000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "07:44  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "7", "median drinks per binge": "5.6", "longitude": "-85.13630839999999", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "binge drinking (%)": "17.1", "sunset": "20:16  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.7", "hp_day": "1913/01/01", "city_longitude": "-85.0144124", "curphase": "Waning Gibbous", "chronic death percentage": "55.3", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
