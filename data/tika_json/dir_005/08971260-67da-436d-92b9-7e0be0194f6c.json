Right next to the current school is a much larger but condemned school. Kids report few weird occurrences, such as looking at the school and seeing a small child run real quick in front of the window, or hearing a noise come from the building at recess. Or ever seeing a mist at the treetops of the woods directly behind the school. Kids have a few stories about the school. Here are a few, one is that a teacher was to be fire, he flipped out and killed many students and teachers with a gun. The other is that for a while it was an insane asylum, and the last is that the kids teased a girl saying her mother was a witch, so her mother put a curse on the school, and the school caught fire trapping many people inside, they say it is her ghost that causes the fog in the woods. - September 2004 update: Has since been torn down.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.84", "moon_upper_transit": "09:47  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "state_abbrev": "OH", "city_latitude": "39.649508", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:31  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "", "sunrise": "06:04  DT", "median drinks per binge": "5.7", "binge drinking (%)": "17.2", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:34  DT", "latitude_x": "39.6517302", "under 21 death percentage": "2.63", "usgs_region": "", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Ohio", "taxpayer cost": "8520000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "17:09  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "", "latitude_y": "39.9612", "longitude": "-82.74044769999999", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "21:04  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-82.7443367", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "54.8", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
