He was a bootlegger. Most likely why he was killed. Around 1987 a former employee worked there while it was called Bradford's. She saw some weird stuff happening. One night she was closing up and heard somebody call her name from the kitchen. She looked up and saw no one. Her friend who was working there heard it to and asked, \u201dwhat was that?\u201d they were the only 2 working. The cook had left earlier. The lights flicker for no reason.
