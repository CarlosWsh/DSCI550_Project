After her death, thieves broke into her home, killed her faithful dog and stole all of her money, which she had been saving to buy her own tombstone. Mrs. Dollar was buried without any kind of marker, and shortly thereafter the apparition of an old lady was seen walking near the falls. So many sightings were reported that a collection was taken up to pay for her tombstone. After the marker was erected, the sightings decreased, but it's said that you can still see a phantom black dog running around her cabin.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.06", "longitude_y": "-86.3006", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.945179584120983", "city_latitude": "34.5795282", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:10  ST", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "AL", "sunrise": "04:38  ST", "state_abbrev": "AL", "binge drinking (%)": "13.6", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "79.9", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "11:47  ST", "latitude_x": "34.5509989", "under 21 death percentage": "3.94", "usgs_region": "Southeast", "quarter": "4", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Alabama", "taxpayer cost": "3724000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "13:40  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "2", "latitude_y": "32.377", "longitude": "-85.5913109", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "5.0", "sunset": "18:55  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.7", "hp_day": "1900/12/31", "city_longitude": "-85.5905204", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "49.8", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
