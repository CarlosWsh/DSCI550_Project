Years ago, this couple drove across the bridge and it collapsed on them, thus causing them to fall into the creek below killing them both. The bridge now is paved and well supported. You can drive onto the bridge anytime at night and shut the car off and all artificial light(flashlights, headlights, cell-phone background lights, pager blinking red lights, etc.)must be shut off and wait patiently in the car and this black figure of an average size man will walk from the end of the bridge and to your car and look into the windows. If a woman is in your car it will most likely go to her first and will continue to examine your car. If you crank your car, without turning on your lights, and begin to drive off, the man will chase you until you are off the bridge. Then the ghost will disappear into the night. The ghost is there to try to scare people off the bridge so that they won't face the same fate that the couple did. BEWARE: The ghost doesn't always walk right to your car. Sometimes it just appears at your window and can scare you plum to death. It is best if you do this during a full moon so that there is plenty of \"natural\" light to see the ghost with.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.86", "longitude_y": "-84.388", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_latitude": "34.4497166", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:58  ST", "resident_population": "3943116.0", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Georgia", "median drinks per binge": "5.3", "binge drinking (%)": "15.1", "resident_population_density_rank": "26.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.6", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "14.5", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "69.3", "latitude_x": "34.4970902", "under 21 death percentage": "3.67", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:39  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "6931000000.0", "hp_day": "1963/07/12", "moonset": "20:14  ST", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "3953.0", "witness_count": "2", "state_abbrev": "GA", "longitude": "-84.60110100000001", "curphase": "New Moon", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "19:51  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-84.4592701", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "55.3", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
