It was a funeral home, a brothel, a nursing home, and now it is a college dorm.

There is an old lady and a little boy in one of the rooms that will play tricks on the students by messing around with their blankets and windows at night. Also, there is a young lady in a long white nightgown that walks up and down the front stairs in the evenings.
