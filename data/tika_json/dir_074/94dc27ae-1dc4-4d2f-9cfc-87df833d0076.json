She has short, wavy hair, was dressed in a brown flowered dress that went halfway down her shins, ankle socks, and old shoes. The door is always locked, and as students always assumed it was a closet. They told the teacher. She checked the door, and as it was still locked, she used the school secretaries key to check. The closet was actually a short set of stairs which led to a singular classroom which was no longer used and unknown to the current students. The girl was not found. My father, who attended the same school as a child, told me that the old room was used to teach retarded children in his and his own father's day. It was always locked even then to prevent the children from leaving. Many students as well as some teachers had seen spirit children open or go through the locked door to the classroom at the top of the hidden stairs.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.08", "moon_upper_transit": "09:08  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "state_abbrev": "NY", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:42  DT", "city_latitude": "42.8142432", "state_y": "NY", "state_x": "New York", "median drinks per binge": "5.4", "number_of_tribes": "2.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.4", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:57  DT", "latitude_x": "42.8296532", "under 21 death percentage": "2.03", "usgs_region": "Northeast", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "city_sunrise": "4:57 am", "taxpayer cost": "16330000000.0", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "moonset": "16:37  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "1", "latitude_y": "42.6526", "longitude": "-73.9192649", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "binge drinking (%)": "17.6", "sunset": "20:37  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.3780718336483932", "city_longitude": "-73.9395687", "quarter": "1", "chronic death percentage": "63.3", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
