The headstones have been removed & one large marker listing the names of the dead is located in the second half of the park. Often the park is covered by a mysterious fog patch that does not extend past the roads to the houses on all sides. The fog also does not cover the road that dissects the two halves of the park. Locals say that the fog is the combined anger of the dead at the removal of the headstones. The park has very few visitors per year. Records of this information was once located in the old Whittier museum record room. Additional roomers include the bodies being moved to Rose Hills Cemetery, joggers reported the feeling of being watched, dead cats mysteriously found on the cemetery grounds, and the list goes on.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.29", "moon_upper_transit": "09:26  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "16.824196597353495", "city_latitude": "33.9791793", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:10  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "CA", "sunrise": "05:42  DT", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "binge drinking (%)": "16.6", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:08  DT", "latitude_x": "33.9869262", "under 21 death percentage": "2.49", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "usgs_region": "Pacific", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "California", "taxpayer cost": "35011000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:48  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "", "state_abbrev": "CA", "longitude": "-118.0451383", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "89.0", "sunset": "20:34  DT", "robbery": "", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-118.032844", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "64.4", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
