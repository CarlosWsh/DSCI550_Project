Mostly though, you would get the feeling that someone was walking behind you or watching over your shoulder. Also, some parts of the library will be really warm, but when you go into an older section, you will be freezing cold. Also, computer problems happened where they wouldn't work one minute, but the next time you try it, it does. The strangest experience they had was when they were in the basement where they forgot their sweater and no one else was there, because it was after hours. They where down in the basement and they heard footsteps up above me where the juvenile and some of the adult books are. When they went back upstairs, they checked everywhere just to make sure that the boss hadn't come in for something that she for got or something like that, but no one was there. They are still a little weary of being in the library at night now when no one else is there. They talked to the boss and coworkers about this and they said that they have felt something like what was described also, and told the submitter that supposedly one of the old librarians that worked there a long time ago died fairly young in age and still checks on things.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.59", "moon_upper_transit": "09:21  DT", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:05  DT", "city_latitude": "41.0120296", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Pennsylvania", "state_abbrev": "PA", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.7", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:09  DT", "latitude_x": "41.0211812", "under 21 death percentage": "2.67", "usgs_region": "", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "9544000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:44  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "4", "location": "Milton Public Library", "longitude": "-76.84397419999999", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "18.5", "sunset": "20:41  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-76.8477412", "personal theft/larceny": "", "chronic death percentage": "52.4", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
