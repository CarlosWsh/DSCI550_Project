Out of all the apartments in this complex apartment 6 is believed to have the highest spiritual energies. The people that once lived in this apartment were haunted by many spirits and reported hearing their names like \"the wind blowing\" at late hours. Another report about this apartment was when a woman was sitting in the living room watching the TV, the room grew very cold and the numbers on the TV began to change, however the TV remained on one channel.
