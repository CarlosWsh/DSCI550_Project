It was part of Ft. Knox, only accessible from a couple of dirt roads across the street from the old US Cav. store. It\u2019s now been opened to the public and made into a park. There are the remains of the old pump houses and tanks for when this was the main water source for Ft. Knox and Radcliff. On all of my visits (both before and after it being opened to the public) I have been plagued with the feeling of being watched. There is also a distinct aura of wrongness about the reservoir.
