This building is located at the front of the school, near the end of Washington Street. Apparently, a girl student was attending the school dance. She was taken to the basement by two males where she was raped and murdered. Students, staff, as well as custodians, have seen and heard her in the building. Her spirit can be seen from the street walking from one end of the building to the other, as if she was walking through the walls.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.74", "moon_upper_transit": "10:15  ST", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_latitude": "32.0039897", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:18  ST", "resident_population": "951023.0", "state_y": "", "state_x": "New Mexico", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "48.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.6", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "39.6", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "35.6822", "latitude_x": "31.997555", "resident_population_density": "7.8", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:05  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "2233000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "17:17  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "4", "state_abbrev": "NM", "longitude": "-106.6585028", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "binge drinking (%)": "15.6", "sunset": "19:23  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "1960/12/31", "city_longitude": "-106.6058257", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "61.2", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
