If you pull up into the church's driveway, turn your headlights out, honk 3 times, then pull back out into the road facing the way you came. A circle of lights will come at you. Supposedly, it has something to do with a battle fought near there. - March 2004 additional info: On Edisto Island there is a church w/ a ghost in its graveyard. A little girl got really sick and fell into a coma. She was pronounced dead and buried in a family mausoleum. Later when another family member died, they opened the tomb to find the little girl's skeleton at the door and her coffin open. Since then her ghost has not allowed the door to close on the mausoleum. Various ways of closing have been tried, none work. The last effort was to chain the door closed with huge chains and a huge lock. To this day the door lays on the ground off its hinges.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.88", "moon_upper_transit": "09:38  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.1890359168241966", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:44  DT", "city_latitude": "32.5503474", "state_y": "SC", "sunrise": "06:13  DT", "median drinks per binge": "5.7", "binge drinking (%)": "16.3", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "82.7", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "70.8", "latitude_x": "32.798279", "resident_population_density": "", "usgs_region": "Southeast", "sun_upper_transit": "13:26  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "South Carolina", "taxpayer cost": "3983000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:47  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "2586.0", "witness_count": "3", "state_abbrev": "SC", "longitude": "-80.40044809999999", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "1.0", "sunset": "20:39  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-80.2971369", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "54.5", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
