According to the report, several years prior to the University's becoming coed in 1949, a female student was sunbathing on a balcony on the roof of the shadowy gothic building. As is typical in Florida, a sudden and particularly violent thunderstorm arose to the east of the building, and welled up ominously over the campus. Although the sky directly above the dormitory was blue, a freak lightning bolt snaked across the sky, curling over the building's turrets striking a sunbathing female student, killing her instantly. Since that time, subsequent occupants of the room she occupied have reported mysterious object movements, unexplained sounds in the room at night, and at times an overwhelming sense of another individual present in the room. Sometimes students would find that common items, such as stacks of books or pictures, would be moved around during the day, with no apparent rhyme or reason, other than perhaps a restless spirit seeking to maintain her link with the world of the living.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.46", "longitude_y": "-84.2807", "aggravated assault": "", "city_latitude": "30.4382559", "begin_civil_twilight": "06:08  DT", "resident_population": "6789443.0", "state_y": "FL", "sunrise": "06:35  DT", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "binge drinking (%)": "17.5", "resident_population_density_rank": "16.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "85.9", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "37.1", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "69.2", "latitude_x": "30.4418778", "resident_population_density": "126.6", "usgs_region": "Southeast", "sun_upper_transit": "13:39  DT", "city_sunrise": "5:43 am", "state_x": "Florida", "taxpayer cost": "15322000000.0", "hp_day": "1971/07/01", "moonset": "19:56  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "2", "state_abbrev": "FL", "longitude": "-84.2984889", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "3.0", "sunset": "20:42  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.5671077504725899", "city_longitude": "-84.28073289999999", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "60.8", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
