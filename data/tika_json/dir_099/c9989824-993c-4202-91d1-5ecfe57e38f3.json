The 1st is the story of an orphan that was murdered by another. On the second floor of the school there are still 2 halls left with the original bedrooms- still not converted to classrooms. The halls are on the same floor as the chapel. Students have claimed to see furniture move in those rooms. There is 1 old rocking horse in particular that will ALWAYS MOVE ON ITS OWN when the room is occupied for too long. Because of the hostile vibe felt in that room, people believe that is the spirit of the murdering orphan, who also died there due to a \"freak\" accident. There are also reports of students seeing two children late at night, running, fighting, and screaming through those halls. The 2nd story is the tale of a nun who taught at the orphanage. She hung herself in the bell tower and haunts it to this day. Many times the bell will ring unexpectedly and late at night a light will go on and off. Unlike the modern light that is suppose to be up there (which seems to always mysteriously short out), it looks like a candle. Students who have tried to get up there have been spooked severely. The school has had the bell tower sealed off for years. Some students have reported coming back from school dances and looking up to see the nun looking at them from the bell tower.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.59", "moon_upper_transit": "07:15  ST", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:04  ST", "city_latitude": "39.9470567", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Pennsylvania", "state_abbrev": "PA", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.7", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "40.2732", "latitude_x": "39.9533093", "under 21 death percentage": "2.67", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:09  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "9544000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "14:12  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "2", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "longitude": "-75.2814674", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "18.5", "sunset": "19:40  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "1900/07/31", "city_longitude": "-75.2921301", "personal theft/larceny": "", "chronic death percentage": "52.4", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
