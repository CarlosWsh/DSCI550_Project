The most famous is the spirit of Inez Clark. Inez was just shy of seven years old when she was struck by lightening at a family picnic. Her parents, distraught over the loss, had a life-size statue of the child erected at her grave site. The statue is enclosed in glass, protecting it from the elements. On rainy nights, when thunder is rolling, the statue reportedly disappears from the glass box, and a young girl can be seen roaming the cemetery grounds.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.51", "moon_upper_transit": "16:06  ST", "city_latitude": "41.8781136", "begin_civil_twilight": "03:57  ST", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Illinois", "median drinks per binge": "5.7", "binge drinking (%)": "20.5", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "82.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "39.798", "latitude_x": "41.954837", "under 21 death percentage": "3.48", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:00  ST", "city_sunrise": "4:52 am", "taxpayer cost": "9716000000.0", "hp_day": "1863/07/06", "moonset": "22:33  ST", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "1", "state_abbrev": "IL", "longitude": "-87.661881", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "19:30  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_longitude": "-87.6297982", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "57.4", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
