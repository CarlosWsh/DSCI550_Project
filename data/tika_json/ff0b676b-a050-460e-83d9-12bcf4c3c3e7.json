You will come to a \"Y\" in the road, where you will hang a right. You will soon after see a small cluster of pillars at the entrance of a gravel road. This site used to be swampy and marshy and there have been at least 8 decaying bodies found there (reported by Mississinewa staff). This site may be an old burial ground of some sort or battlefield, as to the thousands of spirits hiding within the trees. You will drive down this gravel road, and the trees will begin to swarm and intertwine above you. You will then come to a circle. Getting out the car, it is said that if you whistle, someone will begin whistling with you from deep in the forest. It is also said that a noise like a pig squeel and dogs barking can be heard like it is right next to you. And last but NOT least, you will hear screams like a small child is being tortured; supposedly it is a 7-year-old girl named Stephanie. Also, traveling a long a path you will find a tree that has indents that appear to be much like deer antlers; HOWEVER, these are horizontal instead of vertical and have a place for an opposable thumb. - Warning: DO NOT GO HERE, UNLESS YOU REALLY WANT TO BE TERRIFIED. (P.S. Do not \"Ouija\" here for the spirits do not like it.)", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.65", "longitude_y": "-86.1581", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:44  DT", "city_latitude": "40.7536528", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Indiana", "state_abbrev": "IN", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.8", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "328.0", "male death percentage": "70.5", "latitude_x": "40.3120256", "resident_population_density": "", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:46  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "4468000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "8", "latitude_y": "39.7684", "longitude": "-84.7289394", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "binge drinking (%)": "17.1", "sunset": "21:16  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.7", "hp_day": "2023/03/16", "city_longitude": "-86.0688811", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "55.3", "rape/sexual assault": "30.0", "robbery": "53.0"}
