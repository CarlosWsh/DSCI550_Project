Most of the people who have claimed to have seen her are ones who stay after for extracurricular activities. She has no face so she is known as the faceless nun. When she is seen, she is walking down the hall with her head bowed down and her hands folded as if she is praying. Every year, incoming freshmen within their first two weeks of classes are told the story of the faceless nun. Some don't believe it, yet a lot of students, past and present, as well as teachers, have claimed to see her.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.59", "moon_upper_transit": "09:21  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:05  DT", "city_latitude": "40.44062479999999", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Pennsylvania", "state_abbrev": "PA", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.7", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:09  DT", "latitude_x": "40.50220470000001", "under 21 death percentage": "2.67", "usgs_region": "", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "city_sunrise": "5:22 am", "taxpayer cost": "9544000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:44  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "1", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "longitude": "-80.1565514", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "binge drinking (%)": "18.5", "sunset": "20:41  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-79.9958864", "personal theft/larceny": "", "chronic death percentage": "52.4", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
