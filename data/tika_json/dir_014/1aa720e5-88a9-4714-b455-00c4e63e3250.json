This Medina Indian mound is dated back to sometime in the BC\u2019s there is a little plaque before you get to it that tells you the dates so you can find that out if you go check it. you might feel this strong sensation of being held back. Witnesses claim to have taken pictures from the top and had strange glowing figures, and ectomist. Go to the Heuston woods campground. You don't have to pay just go straight thru. its at the end of row b just park on the road. you have to walk through a big field but if you just go straight you'll run smack into it.
