It is fenced off, but you can find ways either under the fence or over it. Many windows have been boarded up but a basement door towards the back of the building is open. Also, many windows are busted out and it is musty, graffiti-filled, and very spooky. You can hear footsteps, see reflections of light, and sometimes a cold draft. Even S.F.P.D. will not enter. - The police patrol the area and it is VERY possible you will get arrested or ticketed. - March 2008 update: Was torn down, there are no new reports since being owned by Lucas Film.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.29", "year": "2008", "moon_upper_transit": "03:18  DT", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "16.824196597353495", "city_latitude": "37.7749295", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:10  DT", "resident_population": "33871648.0", "state_y": "CA", "state_x": "California", "state_abbrev": "CA", "binge drinking (%)": "16.6", "resident_population_density_rank": "14.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "13.8", "simple assault": "218.0", "male death percentage": "69.1", "latitude_x": "37.8005441", "under 21 death percentage": "2.49", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "usgs_region": "Pacific", "sun_upper_transit": "13:08  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "35011000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "08:16  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "longitude": "-122.4497938", "latitude_y": "38.575764", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "89.0", "sunset": "20:34  DT", "robbery": "30.0", "hp_day": "2008/03/01", "city_longitude": "-122.4194155", "curphase": "Waning Gibbous", "chronic death percentage": "64.4", "rape/sexual assault": "23.0"}
