He hanged himself in a stairwell. Perhaps related to that, and perhaps not, there are a couple of rooms (rumors are that they're near his old room, but then again others say that's not so) that have had some freaky things happen. In the early 1990s, this acted up the most. A student was repeatedly locked out of this room, and one night ran out screaming because the bed was occupied by someone who wasn't there. When he came back with the Residential Assistant, the door was locked and they both heard the whole room being trashed by poltergeist activity.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.59", "moon_upper_transit": "11:59  DT", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "11881643.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:05  DT", "city_latitude": "40.7933949", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Pennsylvania", "state_abbrev": "PA", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "10.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.7", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "0.1", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:09  DT", "latitude_x": "40.7982133", "resident_population_density": "265.6", "usgs_region": "", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "9544000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "20:00  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "2", "location": "Pennsylvania State University", "longitude": "-77.8599084", "time_of_day": "Morning", "binge drinking (%)": "18.5", "sunset": "20:41  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "1990/01/01", "city_longitude": "-77.8600012", "personal theft/larceny": "", "chronic death percentage": "52.4", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
