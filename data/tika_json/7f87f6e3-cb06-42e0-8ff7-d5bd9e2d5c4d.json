He died and is said to still walk the deserted country roads. This tunnel can be seen from the road and is no longer in use. Years ago, an electrician was working on the tunnel lights when he became electrocuted and died. He now haunts the tunnel and surrounding area. It is said to have a green glow. - March 2008 Update/additional information: The disfigured face guy was Ray Robinson, who is the true \"Green Man\", not some ghost. He lived near Koppel, Pennsylvania and died in 1985. Ray had his face melted off by a ungrounded railroad bridge in 1917 (his skin turned light green in places after the accident). The ghost in South Park might glow green, but it should NOT be associated with the true \"Green Man\".", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.59", "year": "2008", "longitude_y": "-76.8867", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "12281054.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:05  DT", "city_latitude": "40.2926016", "state_y": "", "sunrise": "05:38  DT", "state_abbrev": "PA", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "12.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.7", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "3.4", "simple assault": "218.0", "sun_upper_transit": "13:09  DT", "latitude_x": "40.272388", "under 21 death percentage": "2.67", "usgs_region": "", "curphase": "Waning Gibbous", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Pennsylvania", "taxpayer cost": "9544000000.0", "hp_day": "2008/03/20", "moonset": "08:05  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "1", "location": "Green Man's Legend &amp; Green Man's Tunnel", "longitude": "-79.9695575", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "binge drinking (%)": "18.5", "sunset": "20:41  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-79.99759159999999", "quarter": "1", "chronic death percentage": "52.4", "rape/sexual assault": "23.0", "robbery": "30.0"}
