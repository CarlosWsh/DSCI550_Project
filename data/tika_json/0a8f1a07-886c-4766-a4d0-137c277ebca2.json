Bones surface on the football field and a grave collapsed in the front lawn and they had to fill it in. - May 2008 Additional information: One of the football players practicing football and tripped over what turned out to be a coffin that was resurfacing. His father was also present when a femur bone was excavated and determined to be a human bone. Two of his cousins who attended this high school went to the 4th floor with some of their friends and reported actually being able to hear what sounded like people banging on the door as if trying to escape. There was a fire that killed everyone on the 4th floor, which is why it is blocked off. No one knows how the fire got started and -  (according to local legend****) the nearest 3 fire stations that could have been there and probably saved the lives of some of the people on that floor, could not get their station doors to open for the trucks to get out. A station about 5 miles away had to respond and by the time they got there, it was too late. - Talking to a local retired fireman, he hadn\u2019t heard of this local legend, but did report of a fire that happened at Roosevelt when the school was having the floors stripped. 3 off-duty firemen lost their lives while helping with the fire.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.47", "longitude_y": "-92.1735", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "state_abbrev": "MO", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:13  DT", "city_latitude": "38.6270025", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Missouri", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "binge drinking (%)": "18.9", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "80.2", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "70.5", "latitude_x": "38.6002121", "under 21 death percentage": "3.72", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:11  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "4604000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:44  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "3", "location": "Roosevelt High School", "longitude": "-90.2368527", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:37  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-90.1994042", "personal theft/larceny": "", "chronic death percentage": "52.5", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
