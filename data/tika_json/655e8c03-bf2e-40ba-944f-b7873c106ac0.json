It was the big, red and white game (the school colors were red and white). When the pictures were developed they saw a shadowy figure in an old Etowah High School basketball jersey. The Etowah High School was torn down about 50 years earlier, and they turned it into Etowah City School, and the high school kids in Etowah had to travel to Englewood, TN to attend McMinn Central High School. Anyway, they did some research and found out that the boy had actually committed suicide on that court when he was a senior because he lost his last high school basketball game.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.04", "longitude_y": "-86.7816", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "state_abbrev": "TN", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:00  DT", "city_latitude": "35.3234065", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Tennessee", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "binge drinking (%)": "15.7", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.8", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "36.1627", "latitude_x": "35.3272064", "resident_population_density": "", "median binges monthly": "1.7", "usgs_region": "", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "4684000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:16  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "1", "location": "Etowah City School", "longitude": "-84.53407849999999", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:08  DT", "robbery": "", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-84.5249307", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "55.3", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
