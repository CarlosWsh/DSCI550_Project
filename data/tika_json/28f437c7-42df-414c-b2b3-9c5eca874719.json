One of them had urged the others to leave several times, but they did not listen. By 3 A.M that night, four of them were dead, and the last kid survived in the scatter, but refused to explain what had happened, or how he'd survived, to police or anyone.\u00a0 On the first Saturday of every month between 2 and 3 A.M, if survived walks to the gate, and waits to safely guide you through.
