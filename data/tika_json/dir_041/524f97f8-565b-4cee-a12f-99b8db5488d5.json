Richard Luger and family live on the main floor and the rooms upstairs numbers 1-6 were either rented or just for one night stays. Luger would get complaints about room #4. They always said they saw a little girl in a white gown with long curly hair standing at the foot of the bed at night. They could also hear her giggling during various hours of the day, she'd somehow move things, make something fall, or the closet door would open! Luger didn't know what to tell his guests. His grandfather had built the place, Rich didn't know of anything like this happening in the past so he couldn't explain. His daughter sleeps in that room now and her sister, who sleeps in room #6 has claimed to see that little girl run by her room and into room 4. She'd walk in that room and see nothing except her younger sister sound asleep in her bed. It is also said to be haunted in the basement by a man, an old woman, and two women. You never really hear or see the man or old woman as much as you can hear the two women talking.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "1.89", "longitude_y": "-100.7837", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.7561436672967864", "resident_population": "619636.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:09  ST", "city_latitude": "46.0869408", "state_y": "ND", "state_x": "North Dakota", "state_abbrev": "ND", "binge drinking (%)": "22.7", "resident_population_density_rank": "43.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "82.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "-3.5", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "70.3", "latitude_x": "", "resident_population_density": "9.0", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "usgs_region": "Midwest", "quarter": "2", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "487600000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "00:09  ST", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "347.0", "witness_count": "2", "latitude_y": "46.8208", "longitude": "", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "4.0", "sunset": "20:41  ST", "robbery": "", "hp_day": "1950/05/01", "city_longitude": "-100.6301271", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "62.2", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
