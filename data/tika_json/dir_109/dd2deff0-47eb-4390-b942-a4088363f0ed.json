Legend goes...mother killed her daughter, and then died a few years later, after the family had put angel by daughter's grave. It is said that angry spirit of mother resides in angel. Sometime after mother died, local livestock began to show up mysteriously slaughtered in cruel, sadistic manner. Blood was found on hands and mouth of angel, prompting locals to suspect the mother had possessed the angel, and was doing the vile deeds. Local officials took matters into their own hands, clipping the wings of the angels and cutting off the hands. After this, the angel was forced to remain within the cemetery, flightless and without ability to kill. Soon after, rusty streak marks developed under the angel's eyes, as though she was crying for her sins.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.84", "moon_upper_transit": "20:34  DT", "aggravated assault": "119.0", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "state_abbrev": "OH", "city_latitude": "41.4219889", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:31  DT", "resident_population": "10847115.0", "state_y": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:34  DT", "median drinks per binge": "5.7", "binge drinking (%)": "17.2", "resident_population_density_rank": "11.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "0.5", "simple assault": "365.0", "male death percentage": "54.8", "latitude_x": "41.3670519", "resident_population_density": "265.5", "usgs_region": "", "quarter": "4", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Ohio", "taxpayer cost": "8520000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "02:06  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "1", "latitude_y": "39.9612", "longitude": "-82.379767", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "21:04  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "hp_day": "1999/12/31", "city_longitude": "-82.36460679999999", "curphase": "Waxing Gibbous", "chronic death percentage": "54.8", "rape/sexual assault": "40.0", "robbery": "72.0"}
