The police would go and investigate only to walk into the school and find that the music and the lights have been turned off abruptly. Some people, believe that the prom or homecoming was supposed to be the night of the tornado that destroyed the high school that was there before the elementary school. you can hear doors close and loud footprints behind you, rolling carts down the hallways, drawers opening and closing, and computers have powered up by themselves before. One encounter seen by the school janitor was of a young girl sitting in the corner of the gymnasium crying and pointing at the bleachers saying, \"Look at the lady in white by the coat rack. She's crying.\" (There is no coat rack in the gymnasium, by the way.) Back in the earlier days of the school, a child fell through the roof of the building.
