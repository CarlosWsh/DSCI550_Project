It is an old Historic cemetery that locals say is haunted and that there is unusual activity that goes on there. Locals say to park your car on the side of the road near the cemetery and look at the small prayer chapel that is located in the middle of the cemetery, while being quiet, you can hear moans and high pitch noises coming from the chapel and at times there seems to be a low glooming light that emerges from the foundation of the chapel, locals say that upon approaching the cemetery at night there seems to be an unexplainable chill that goes down your spine every time you try to pass through the arch at the entrance of the cemetery. (Be careful when visiting, because the authorities have been known to patrol the dirt road frequently.) -  It would be a good idea to let the proper authorities know what you are doing and ALWAYS get permission.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.86", "moon_upper_transit": "20:39  DT", "aggravated assault": "119.0", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_latitude": "31.2643494", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:58  DT", "resident_population": "6478216.0", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Georgia", "state_abbrev": "GA", "binge drinking (%)": "15.1", "resident_population_density_rank": "23.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.6", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "18.6", "simple assault": "365.0", "male death percentage": "69.3", "latitude_x": "31.2878085", "under 21 death percentage": "3.67", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:39  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "6931000000.0", "hp_day": "1999/12/31", "moonset": "02:11  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "", "median drinks per binge": "5.3", "longitude": "-84.0574603", "curphase": "Waxing Gibbous", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:51  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-84.0212897", "quarter": "4", "chronic death percentage": "55.3", "rape/sexual assault": "40.0", "robbery": "72.0"}
