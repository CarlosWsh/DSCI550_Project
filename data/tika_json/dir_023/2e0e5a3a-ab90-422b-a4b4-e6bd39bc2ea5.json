The 200 or so captives were taken North to Canada, along the way crossing over the Green River in present-day Greenfield. Eunice Williams, wife of the town's reverend who just hours before had given birth, was hacked to death in the river by an Indian. Today, a plaque set in a stone tells the tale, and a covered bridge looms beside it connecting North Greenfield and the Meadows section of town. It is said that Eunice shows herself here, at night, when motorists stop inside the bridge, turn off their headlights, and beep once. Other sightings have been beside the dam above the bridge, and downstream in the middle of the river.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.61", "moon_upper_transit": "08:57  DT", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:33  DT", "city_latitude": "42.587915", "state_y": "MA", "state_x": "Massachusetts", "state_abbrev": "MA", "number_of_tribes": "2.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "84.4", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "68.4", "latitude_x": "42.64648709999999", "resident_population_density": "", "usgs_region": "Northwest", "sun_upper_transit": "12:46  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "5635000000.0", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "moonset": "16:25  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "2760.0", "witness_count": "", "latitude_y": "42.3601", "longitude": "-72.6202139", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "21.1", "sunset": "20:25  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.5", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.3780718336483932", "city_longitude": "-72.5994104", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "59.3", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
