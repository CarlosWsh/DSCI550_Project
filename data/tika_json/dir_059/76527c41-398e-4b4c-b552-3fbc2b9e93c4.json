Janitors report locking doors with chains and having the chains unlocked. Strange footsteps heard through small gym, like someone walking on old floorboards.

Many say they still haunt the school to this day and want revenge by whoever decided to lock them in. - December 2006 Update: Gibsonburg has torn down the old school and a new one has been built.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.84", "moon_upper_transit": "09:47  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:31  DT", "city_latitude": "41.3844964", "state_y": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:34  DT", "state_abbrev": "OH", "binge drinking (%)": "17.2", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "54.8", "latitude_x": "41.3759555", "under 21 death percentage": "2.63", "usgs_region": "", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Ohio", "taxpayer cost": "8520000000.0", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "moonset": "17:09  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "3", "latitude_y": "39.9612", "longitude": "-83.3220851", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "21:04  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_longitude": "-83.32048069999999", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "54.8", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
