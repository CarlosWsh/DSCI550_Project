First is the spirit of a Chief of the Miami tribe that tried to prevent the city from building on the tribe's burial site. The school mascot is called Chief Mac in his honor. Second is that of a teenage girl seen in the gym and indoor running track. She is often seen in the morning before school starts. A janitor haunts the basement where he died of a heart attack several years ago. Many janitors have reported seeing him. Finally, a construction worker haunts the stage area of the auditorium. During the building of the school, it partially collapsed, killing him and injuring many others. It is a little scary walking the halls alone at night. A magazine covered the stories back in the seventies. - October 2004 update: there was contruction that lasted a year or 2 that just finished summer 2004. There was comments from the contruction workers they seen alot of stuff happening which may have been the worker who died warning them of the dangers.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.65", "longitude_y": "-86.1581", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "6080485.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:44  DT", "city_latitude": "41.079273", "state_y": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:47  DT", "state_abbrev": "IN", "binge drinking (%)": "17.1", "resident_population_density_rank": "18.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.8", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "9.7", "simple assault": "239.0", "male death percentage": "70.5", "latitude_x": "41.09723", "resident_population_density": "169.7", "usgs_region": "", "quarter": "4", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Indiana", "taxpayer cost": "4468000000.0", "hp_day": "2004/12/31", "moonset": "", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "", "location": "North Side High School", "longitude": "-85.13271", "latitude_y": "39.7684", "time_of_day": "Morning", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "21:16  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.7", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-85.1393513", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "55.3", "rape/sexual assault": "16.0", "robbery": "35.0"}
