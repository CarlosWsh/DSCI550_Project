Apparently a little girl about 9 years old with blond hair was hit and killed by a car in the early 70's. Today guests report seeing a little 9 year old girl come running up to them crying \"Mommy, Mommy, Please help me find my Mommy!\". The guests usually think this is a typical lost child. The guests agree to take the girl to someone to find her mommy and proceed with her. They get no more than 10 yards when they notice the little girl has completely disappeared and is nowhere in sight. Some people have actually gotten a photo of the little girl.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.86", "moon_upper_transit": "03:28  DT", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "4589575.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:58  DT", "city_latitude": "33.8126059", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Georgia", "state_abbrev": "GA", "binge drinking (%)": "15.1", "resident_population_density_rank": "26.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.6", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "16.4", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "69.3", "latitude_x": "33.7705277", "under 21 death percentage": "3.67", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:39  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "6931000000.0", "hp_day": "1970/07/01", "moonset": "08:31  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "3953.0", "witness_count": "1", "location": "Six Flags Over Georgia", "longitude": "-84.55153700000001", "curphase": "Waning Gibbous", "time_of_day": "Morning", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:51  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-84.6343783", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "55.3", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
