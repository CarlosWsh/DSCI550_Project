Sightings of a ghostly young girl between the ages of 8-12 have also been mentioned in the house and the surrounding gardens. The spirit is believed to be the daughter of Captain Andrew C. Zabriskie, the former owner and builder of the house. One winter their daughter either fell or jumped to her death out the window of their New York apartment and it is said she remains at the summer house because she disliked Manhattan while alive. An eerie postscript: before her death, Capt. Zabriskie commissioned a sculptor to create 4 statues of her for each 3 years of her life up to the age of 12 in the gardens; but to this day only three statues are present, along with an empty pedestal for the fourth one.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.08", "longitude_y": "-73.7562", "aggravated assault": "", "state_abbrev": "NY", "city_latitude": "42.0218762", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:42  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "NY", "state_x": "New York", "median drinks per binge": "5.4", "number_of_tribes": "2.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.4", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:57  DT", "latitude_x": "42.0203897", "resident_population_density": "", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "usgs_region": "Northeast", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "16330000000.0", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "moonset": "16:37  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "4", "latitude_y": "42.6526", "longitude": "-73.91005439999999", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "binge drinking (%)": "17.6", "sunset": "20:37  DT", "robbery": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.3780718336483932", "city_longitude": "-73.9095279", "quarter": "1", "chronic death percentage": "63.3", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
