There is a large field(about the size of a football field) that is owned by the cemetary. At the end of the field, there is a wooded area. To the left, it appears to be a large path/clearing. That is where the private cemetary is. It's very shady, fenced in, and surrounded by houses. There are a handful of old graves, scattered about, so if venturing there in the dark, be careful not to trip and fall. The cemetary is closed from Sunset to Sunrise. So there is no trespassing while it is closed. And be respectful of the people living in the area.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.19", "moon_upper_transit": "16:13  DT", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "1.890359168241966", "city_latitude": "42.6780726", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:43  DT", "resident_population": "5363675.0", "state_y": "WI", "sun_upper_transit": "12:59  DT", "state_abbrev": "WI", "binge drinking (%)": "25.8", "resident_population_density_rank": "26.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "9.6", "simple assault": "229.0", "latitude_y": "43.0731", "latitude_x": "42.67336239999999", "under 21 death percentage": "2.3", "usgs_region": "Midwest", "quarter": "3", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Wisconsin", "taxpayer cost": "4453000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "23:46  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "longitude": "-88.3011487", "time_of_day": "Morning", "number_of_tribes": "10.0", "sunset": "20:41  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.7", "hp_day": "2004/09/20", "city_longitude": "-88.27620259999999", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "63.2", "rape/sexual assault": "21.0", "robbery": "42.0"}
