It is enclosed by an old rock wall. The football field was also used as a mass grave during a cholera epidemic. It is also said that three women were hung on a tree in the old family cemetery. They had been accused of witchcraft. Teachers have told of hearing a woman humming while walking the halls. Also the smell of rose perfume will suddenly overtake a room. If you visit the school after dark you may see shadow figures in the old cemetery. If you leave your car and go down to the cemetery your car will start by itself and the lights will go on and off. Custodians have also told of seeing three ladies, all dressed in red walking side by side in the halls at night.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.19", "moon_upper_transit": "18:50  ST", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "2416630.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:45  ST", "city_latitude": "37.895573", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Kentucky", "state_abbrev": "KY", "binge drinking (%)": "15.8", "resident_population_density_rank": "15.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.7", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "5.5", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "70.6", "latitude_x": "37.8806341", "under 21 death percentage": "2.67", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:41  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "3195000000.0", "hp_day": "1923/10/01", "moonset": "00:25  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "13", "latitude_y": "38.1868", "longitude": "-84.5729961", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:06  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-84.56414699999999", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "53.5", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
