It gets its name from all the cemeteries that are on it. Some of them date back to the late 1890's and early 1900's. An old man lived alone with is dog on Cemetery Mt., and during hunting season, he took the dog out with him. It is said that other hunters thought the dog was a deer, and killed the dog. The old man never found his dog. It\u2019s also said that the old man died soon after. Some time later, some hunters heard a shot, and came upon a black lab dog that was still alive. They stood up, looked around and saw this old man. The old man asked them if they had seen his dog. The hunters said yes and turned to point, but the dog was gone. They turned back around and the old man was gone too! Other happenings are, red eyes can be seen about one foot off of the ground. People think they are imps or goblins. Also, there is an old church in the woods w ith a book on the podium. You can pick it up, but it starts to get heavier as you try to walk out the door with it. Before you get to the door, the book gets so heavy, you can't carry it out. The book is rumored to be a copy of the devil\u2019s bible. Satanic rituals are rumored to have been held there.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.06", "year": "1897", "moon_upper_transit": "05:19  ST", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.945179584120983", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:10  ST", "city_latitude": "33.5298282", "state_y": "AL", "state_x": "Alabama", "state_abbrev": "AL", "binge drinking (%)": "13.6", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "79.9", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "11:47  ST", "latitude_x": "33.4109427", "under 21 death percentage": "3.94", "median binges monthly": "1.7", "usgs_region": "Southeast", "quarter": "2", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "3724000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "11:37  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "7", "latitude_y": "32.377", "longitude": "-85.9802455", "time_of_day": "Morning", "number_of_tribes": "5.0", "sunset": "18:55  ST", "robbery": "", "hp_day": "1897/06/30", "city_longitude": "-85.95080050000001", "curphase": "Waning Gibbous", "chronic death percentage": "49.8", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
