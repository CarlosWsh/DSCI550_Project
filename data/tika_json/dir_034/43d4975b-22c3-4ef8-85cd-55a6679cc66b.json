Apparitions have been seen walking across the Lickskillet Railroad Bridge. The apparitions are dressed like from the 1800's wear but since the park has only been there since 1967 the spirits are likely those from the train robbery which was put on each train ride back in Six Flags' early history. No noise comes from the apparitions, however. They just walk by as if going to wait for the next train to come by so they can have their hourly shoot-out with the conductor and the engineers.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.86", "longitude_y": "-84.388", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:58  DT", "city_latitude": "33.8126059", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Georgia", "state_abbrev": "GA", "binge drinking (%)": "15.1", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.6", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "69.3", "latitude_x": "33.7705277", "under 21 death percentage": "3.67", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:39  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "6931000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "17:00  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "3953.0", "witness_count": "2", "location": "Six Flags Over Georgia", "longitude": "-84.55153700000001", "time_of_day": "Morning", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:51  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_longitude": "-84.6343783", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "55.3", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
