Years later, the church burnt down. One night a young couple went parking at the church. Not long afterwards, when they were ready to leave, the car would not start. The guy told his girlfriend to stay in the car and keep the doors locked while he went to get help. When he came back, she was gone and the doors were still locked. He looked up, only to find her hanging from the old oak tree in front of the church. Sometimes at night you can see a figure hanging from that same tree. Some witnesses even claim that they have been chased by a phantom hearse near the site of the old church.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.0", "longitude_y": "-76.4922", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_latitude": "39.6417629", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:08  ST", "resident_population": "1631526.0", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Maryland", "median drinks per binge": "5.3", "binge drinking (%)": "14.5", "resident_population_density_rank": "9.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "79.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "12.5", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "38.9784", "latitude_x": "39.7138898", "under 21 death percentage": "3.22", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:07  ST", "city_sunrise": "5:14 am", "taxpayer cost": "4965000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "14:26  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "2", "state_abbrev": "MD", "longitude": "-77.6362534", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "19:35  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "hp_day": "1930/01/01", "city_longitude": "-77.71999319999999", "personal theft/larceny": "", "chronic death percentage": "46.6", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
