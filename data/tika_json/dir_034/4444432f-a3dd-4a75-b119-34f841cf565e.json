Students in this residential hall have reported strange noises, cold spots, and movement of objects. Lawther Hall has always been a women's dorm, and at no time was it ever used as an infirmary. During the war it was used partially as a dormitory for WAVES- definitely not men. In fact, the stories told of Augie center largely around the fifth (or perhaps fourth) floor attic areas. These were never used as rooms, but were originally recreational areas for the women in the dorm. In the early 70's, these rooms were closed (1972, I believe) because they were deemed in disrepair and quite unsafe. For a few years, a hall Halloween Haunted House called \"Augie's Attic\" was held there until a fire started accidentally one year, and the activity was banned. In fact, to say that Lawther is the dorm that is primarily haunted could be entirely incorrect. Next door to Lawther, in fact attached to, is Bartlett Hall. Bartlett has an identical layout, and though is now coed, was once all female as well. To suggest that the two have been confused is not unlikely.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.15", "moon_upper_transit": "09:31  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.1890359168241966", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:06  DT", "city_latitude": "42.5348993", "state_y": "IA", "state_x": "Iowa", "state_abbrev": "IA", "binge drinking (%)": "24.5", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "88.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "41.5908", "latitude_x": "42.5133893", "under 21 death percentage": "2.45", "usgs_region": "Midwest", "sun_upper_transit": "13:16  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "1934000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:58  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "8", "median drinks per binge": "5.8", "longitude": "-92.4620034", "time_of_day": "Morning", "number_of_tribes": "1.0", "sunset": "20:52  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-92.4453161", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "67.0", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
