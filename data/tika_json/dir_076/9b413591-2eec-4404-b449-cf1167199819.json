During the daylight hours, voices of children playing and adults talking can be heard. At night strange orbs can be seen floating along the roadways some as large as a basketball. In some of the homes, sounds of dishes breaking, and none were ever seen to have been broken. Closets in the home would have auras of foreboding, as if some one was staring at you as you passed. One homeowner shot a trespassing dog at night only to find that it vanished before his eyes at point blank range. As children walk from one home to another, they would here additional footsteps along side. During a family get together several family members slept out in the back yard under a night-light placed in the yard, during the night they awoke to see a hat that belonging to the owner of the house rise from the table, lift about 6 feet in the air, go toward the back door. Once there the screen door opened and the hat proceeded inward after a brief pause. The screen door shut after the hat entered.
