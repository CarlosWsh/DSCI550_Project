It was once part of the Ohio Turnpike built in 1831, until the state rebuilt the road into a straight four-lane road in 1969. In October of that year, five teens were killed when their 1968 Impala was hit by a 1969 Roadrunner going more than 100 miles per hour. Only one guy survived. Since that day, the intersection has been haunted by a faceless hitchhiker, who the survivor has personally seen at least five times. The ghost is described as a shadowy figure in three dimensions. Psychics with no knowledge of the site have described it as very evil. A driverless Impala and a ghostly green Roadrunner have been seen in the area as well.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.84", "longitude_y": "-82.9988", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_latitude": "39.0283966", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:31  DT", "resident_population": "11353140.0", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Ohio", "state_abbrev": "OH", "binge drinking (%)": "17.2", "resident_population_density_rank": "11.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "4.7", "simple assault": "278.0", "sun_upper_transit": "13:34  DT", "latitude_x": "", "under 21 death percentage": "2.63", "usgs_region": "", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "8520000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "00:57  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "5", "location": "formerly submitted as Columbus", "longitude": "", "latitude_y": "39.9612", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "21:04  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "hp_day": "2007/04/20", "city_longitude": "-84.2177136", "quarter": "2", "chronic death percentage": "54.8", "rape/sexual assault": "17.0", "robbery": "54.0"}
