This was in the mid 90's. There are two places that he can be heard and one that he has been seen. On nights that the moon is not out if you stop and go under the bridge its really cold and you can hear heavy breathing and moaning. Also if you walk through the woods there at night you can hear breathing and a feeling of being watched. A young man has also been spotted walking along the road that runs parallel to Broadway back in the forest but as you get close to him he disappears.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.69", "longitude_y": "-97.7431", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_latitude": "32.7995738", "begin_civil_twilight": "06:02  DT", "resident_population": "16986510.0", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Texas", "state_abbrev": "TX", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "31.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.9", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "19.4", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "30.2672", "latitude_x": "32.8096157", "resident_population_density": "65.0", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:33  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "18821000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "19:54  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "2", "median drinks per binge": "5.6", "longitude": "-97.2694286", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "17.6", "sunset": "20:36  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "1990/07/30", "city_longitude": "-97.2691817", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "56.9", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
