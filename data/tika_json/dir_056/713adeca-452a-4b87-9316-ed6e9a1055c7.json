One is the ghost of a man who had hung himself. If you drive through the bridge and park in the middle facing the side farthest from the mill you will see his ghost. The ghost tends to walk back and fourth. Sometimes he will do no more than step out and back. Aslo you should hear the voice of a man talking. Occasionally the ghost will walk up to the car and even hit it. Very large, bright, white orbs can also be seen. The other two ghost are those of a couple who were hit by a train. They tend to linger around the top of the bridge-walking together-holding hands.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.59", "moon_upper_transit": "09:21  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:05  DT", "city_latitude": "40.3359086", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Pennsylvania", "state_abbrev": "PA", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.7", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "69.0", "latitude_x": "40.3388332", "under 21 death percentage": "2.67", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:09  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "9544000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:44  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "3", "latitude_y": "40.2732", "longitude": "-78.4051669", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "binge drinking (%)": "18.5", "sunset": "20:41  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-78.3908471", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "52.4", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
