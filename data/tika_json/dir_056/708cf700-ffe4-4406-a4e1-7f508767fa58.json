The fifth floor is closed due to a fire that occurred there. The elevators and stairs are locked but one day just to see if the elevator would indeed not work some students tried to take it up to the fifth floor, and it worked. Once inside they began asking questions with their tape recorder going and they got a chill and an eerie feeling. They immediately ran out and later played the tape, only to discover there were at least 2 ghosts up there. One was a very friendly gentleman's voice and the other a very rude and violent girl's voice that named herself as \"Stacy.\" Since then the elevators haven't worked, they have tried again and again, but if you live on the fourth floor you can hear the furniture moving among other noises, which can't be explained. Though the fire did not kill anyone there was a suicide that occurred some 20 years ago by a girl who had been raped on the fifth floor. She threw herself off the roof and landed at the stairs, as for the man's voice it is not known where he comes from.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.47", "year": "2008", "longitude_y": "-92.1735", "aggravated assault": "46.0", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "state_abbrev": "MO", "city_latitude": "38.9517053", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:13  DT", "resident_population": "5595211.0", "state_y": "", "sunrise": "05:45  DT", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "binge drinking (%)": "18.9", "resident_population_density_rank": "29.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "80.2", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "9.3", "simple assault": "274.0", "sun_upper_transit": "13:11  DT", "latitude_x": "38.9536151", "resident_population_density": "81.4", "usgs_region": "", "curphase": "Waning Gibbous", "city_sunrise": "5:29 am", "state_x": "Missouri", "taxpayer cost": "4604000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "08:13  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "1", "latitude_y": "38.5767", "longitude": "-92.3195515", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:37  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "2008/05/20", "city_longitude": "-92.3340724", "quarter": "2", "chronic death percentage": "52.5", "rape/sexual assault": "3.0", "robbery": "41.0"}
