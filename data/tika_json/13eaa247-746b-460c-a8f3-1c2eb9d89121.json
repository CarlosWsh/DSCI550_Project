Since it's first days as a private residence it has since been converted into co-ed dormitories. There was an old elevator that used to be in service in the house and has since been sealed up. Apparently there was a young man who was stuck in the elevator and died when it fell. People still claim to hear the squeals of the elevator gears as it falls. There is also rumored to be the spirit of a young girl who walks around the 3rd floor. She was supposed to be the niece of the President of the University. She died in the house and still wanders the halls. The boys who live on the top floor can sometimes hear the laugh of the little girl.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.51", "longitude_y": "-89.644", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "state_abbrev": "IL", "city_latitude": "40.4842027", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:58  DT", "resident_population": "12812508.0", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Illinois", "median drinks per binge": "5.7", "binge drinking (%)": "20.5", "resident_population_density_rank": "14.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "82.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "-0.1", "simple assault": "266.0", "sun_upper_transit": "13:01  DT", "latitude_x": "40.4908892", "resident_population_density": "230.8", "usgs_region": "", "curphase": "New Moon", "city_sunrise": "4:58 am", "taxpayer cost": "9716000000.0", "hp_day": "2020/10/06", "moonset": "21:10  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "2", "location": "Illinois Weslyan University", "longitude": "-88.9906541", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:30  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-88.99368729999999", "quarter": "4", "chronic death percentage": "57.4", "rape/sexual assault": "35.0", "robbery": "41.0"}
