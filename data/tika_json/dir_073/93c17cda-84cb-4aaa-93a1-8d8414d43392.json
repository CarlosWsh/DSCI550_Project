The two ran away with each other and hid on the slope of Yonah Mountain. A Cherokee search party found them, and Nacoochee's father ordered Sautee thrown off the face of the mountain. Seconds after Sautee was thrown from the mountain, Nacoochee flung herself after him, refusing to live without her love. The two lovers were buried together in a large mound on the banks of the Chattahoochee River. The area is now named after the two. It is said if you desecrate or even tread on the mound, bad fortune will come to you from Indian spirits.
