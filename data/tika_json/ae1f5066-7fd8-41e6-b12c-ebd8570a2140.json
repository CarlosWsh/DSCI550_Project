Three spirits are said to be in residence. One young man seen hammering is believed to be a young man who fell to his death during construction. The second is an elderly woman who stands and watches. The third is a man always described as \"angry\". He is believed to be one of the former owners. Lights are switched on and off, doors and windows open or close by themselves. Doorknobs rattle, voices can be heard, and the sounds of footsteps on the staircase occur quite often. The present owners of the property, who operate the real estate company, say they have never felt afraid or in danger, and are now quite used to the \"other agents\" and their nightly actions.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.29", "longitude_y": "-121.478851", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "16.824196597353495", "resident_population": "2377549.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:09  ST", "city_latitude": "35.3732921", "state_y": "CA", "state_x": "California", "state_abbrev": "CA", "binge drinking (%)": "16.6", "resident_population_density_rank": "38.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "60.1", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:07  ST", "latitude_x": "35.3538897", "under 21 death percentage": "2.49", "usgs_region": "Pacific", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "city_sunrise": "5:00 am", "taxpayer cost": "35011000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "14:13  ST", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "3", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "longitude": "-119.0620533", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "89.0", "sunset": "19:33  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "hp_day": "1911/01/01", "city_longitude": "-119.0187125", "personal theft/larceny": "", "chronic death percentage": "64.4", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
