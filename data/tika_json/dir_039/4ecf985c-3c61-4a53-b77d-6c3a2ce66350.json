The man went in search of his children and never returned and neither did his children. It is said if you drive into the woods by a dirt road you will see his lantern glowing in the distance. It is also said if you scream to the light that you have his children the light will turn red. There are no reports of anyone getting close to the light but if you wait long enough maybe the light will come to you.- December Update: Bingham's lights appear close to the old cemetery, which is actually split into two sections, one on each of two hilltops. If you drive down the road between the graveyards towards the woods you will see the lights. It works best if you get out and walk in that direction. - February 2007 Update: Reported that the place is now gated off, presumably due to people shooting at light.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.88", "moon_upper_transit": "09:38  DT", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.1890359168241966", "city_latitude": "34.5107147", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:44  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "SC", "state_x": "South Carolina", "state_abbrev": "SC", "binge drinking (%)": "16.3", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "82.7", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "70.8", "latitude_x": "", "resident_population_density": "", "usgs_region": "Southeast", "sun_upper_transit": "13:26  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "3983000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:47  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "2586.0", "witness_count": "2", "location": "Binghams light", "longitude": "", "time_of_day": "Morning", "number_of_tribes": "1.0", "sunset": "20:39  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-79.6528354", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "54.5", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
