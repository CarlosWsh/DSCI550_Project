For this old school house, now a fraternity social palace, there is a resident that doesn't want to go away. Myth is that in the early 1900's a little girl was accidentally killed in the school. Not much has happened there while large groups have been present but when it is just a few people, well it is a different story. Windows shaking, doors slamming, lights swaying, figure of a little girl jumping rope in the old building late at night by the neighboring residents and sinister laughing in the furnace room. Ask any Pike at Southeast Missouri State University and they will be clad to tell you more about the \"Lodge\". - Febuary 2005 update: The girl\u2019s name that died is jessica. Till recently, it was True that she only shows up to individuals or small groups, she made her present known at one of our biggest and most recent lodge parties. in the middle of the party she made all the lights go out and the music turn off, all the equipment was running for the sound but nothing came out of the speakers, there were no technical problems, so they decided to just wait it out and eventally they came back on.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.47", "year": "2005", "longitude_y": "-92.1735", "aggravated assault": "94.0", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "5595211.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:13  DT", "city_latitude": "37.3058839", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Missouri", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "binge drinking (%)": "18.9", "resident_population_density_rank": "29.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "80.2", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "9.3", "simple assault": "228.0", "male death percentage": "70.5", "latitude_x": "", "resident_population_density": "81.4", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:11  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "4604000000.0", "hp_day": "2005/02/20", "moonset": "04:44  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "1", "state_abbrev": "MO", "longitude": "", "latitude_y": "38.5767", "time_of_day": "Morning", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:36  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-89.51814759999999", "quarter": "1", "chronic death percentage": "52.5", "rape/sexual assault": "11.0", "robbery": "37.0"}
