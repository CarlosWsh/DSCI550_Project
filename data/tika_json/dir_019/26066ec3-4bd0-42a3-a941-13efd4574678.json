Though it wasn't at the time, the location is now 24 hours and employees say that at nights Mr. Cedars can be heard walking the store or playing jokes (he likes to knock over the stacks of diapers like he did when he was alive). Several people have reported incidents while alone in the stockroom at night, such as toys turning themselves on and off. Occasionally things have been known to fly off shelves and break without anyone nearby. The activity calmed after the convictions of the perpetrators in 1998, but he is still a presence in the store.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.69", "year": "1996", "longitude_y": "-97.7431", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_latitude": "30.1658207", "begin_civil_twilight": "06:02  DT", "resident_population": "16986510.0", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Texas", "state_abbrev": "TX", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "31.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.9", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "19.4", "simple assault": "555.0", "latitude_y": "30.2672", "latitude_x": "30.126243", "resident_population_density": "65.0", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:33  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "18821000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "5", "median drinks per binge": "5.6", "longitude": "-95.4489705", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "17.6", "sunset": "20:36  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "1996/10/01", "city_longitude": "-95.4612625", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "56.9", "rape/sexual assault": "29.0", "robbery": "104.0"}
