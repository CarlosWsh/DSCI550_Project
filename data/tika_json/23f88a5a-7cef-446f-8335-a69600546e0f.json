One legend is about a Setauket Sachem Indian who was not permitted to marry his love from another tribe. He paddled his canoe out to the middle of the lake and committed suicide via a knife to his heart. His body was recovered in another lake in Connecticut. Another is of a young beautiful Indian Princess who was not permitted to marry her pale face lover and she canoed out on the lake and was found dead by him. He in turn got into the canoe and was swept away, never to be seen again. Apparently, there has been a reported drowning each and every year due to a curse placed upon the lake. The myth is that the lake is bottomless. It rises and lowers mysteriously and is rumored to have a secret underwater Connection that stems for miles. Some of the drowning victims as well as the princess are said to still haunt the lake and It's surrounding area.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.08", "longitude_y": "-73.7562", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "1.1342155009451798", "state_abbrev": "NY", "city_latitude": "40.789142", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:42  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "NY", "sunrise": "05:17  DT", "median drinks per binge": "5.4", "number_of_tribes": "6.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.4", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:57  DT", "latitude_x": "40.8320984", "under 21 death percentage": "2.03", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "usgs_region": "Northwest", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "New York", "taxpayer cost": "16330000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:37  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "3", "latitude_y": "42.6526", "longitude": "-73.1053707", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "binge drinking (%)": "17.6", "sunset": "20:37  DT", "robbery": "", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-73.13496099999999", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "63.3", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
