It used to be a dormitory for nuns and has several nuns that don't seem to want to leave; including one in the auditorium that walks down the aisle way from the balcony to a certain seat in the theater, sits down and is visible for a few seconds and the vanishes. She has a very negative, angry vibe about her and is not pleasant to witness. There is also a much nicer spirit in the attic who seems to be sewing when seen, who is a nun also. The west hall way in the apartment building has the spirit of a bride who was left at the alter and later killed herself. there is a male entity in one of the rooms and another in the basement.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.84", "moon_upper_transit": "04:41  ST", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_latitude": "41.6639383", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:30  ST", "resident_population": "6646697.0", "state_y": "", "sunrise": "05:03  ST", "state_abbrev": "OH", "binge drinking (%)": "17.2", "resident_population_density_rank": "10.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "15.4", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:33  ST", "latitude_x": "41.6688001", "resident_population_density": "162.7", "usgs_region": "", "curphase": "Waning Gibbous", "city_sunrise": "5:36 am", "state_x": "Ohio", "taxpayer cost": "8520000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "10:28  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "4", "latitude_y": "39.9612", "longitude": "-83.556027", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:04  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "hp_day": "1935/07/06", "city_longitude": "-83.55521200000001", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "54.8", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
