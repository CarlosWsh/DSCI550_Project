It was said to be that a young boy anxious to skate down one of these hills called Maricopa. While skating down this steep hill without a helmet, he fell face first and tore up his face and arms and knees. To this day on some nights you can still see a small boy with a skateboard in his hand and his face and arms all scraped up. Many people have seen this mysterious boy still skating down all the hills. As soon as you start walking over to help him or see if he is real, he skates away at a seemingly impossible speed never to be seen again that night.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.29", "moon_upper_transit": "09:26  DT", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "16.824196597353495", "state_abbrev": "CA", "city_latitude": "34.2694474", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:10  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "CA", "state_x": "California", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "binge drinking (%)": "16.6", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "69.1", "latitude_x": "34.288428", "under 21 death percentage": "2.49", "usgs_region": "Pacific", "sun_upper_transit": "13:08  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "35011000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:48  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "1", "location": "Indian Hills", "longitude": "-118.686314", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "89.0", "sunset": "20:34  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-118.781482", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "64.4", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
