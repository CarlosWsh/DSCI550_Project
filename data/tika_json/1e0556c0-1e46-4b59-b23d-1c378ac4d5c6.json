It's been the site of a lot of vandalism over the years. At night a male figure can sometimes be seen walking through the small cemetery disappearing into a headstone. The cemetery will be very still and quiet, strangely quiet considering it is under a freeway. If respect is given, it will remain quiet, but as soon as anyone starts messing around, a hot wind picks up out of nowhere. It can only be felt in the cemetery.
