On Pardee. Is known that if you go back there. You will see Blown up cars. There is a mini van. That got blown up. And in the mini van about 4 or 5 years ago. Was a family sleeping. Some one shot the single mom in the back of her neck. But there were still 3 kids in the back of the van still sleeping. The car was on the street Birch. In front of a house. The house is 4 house's down from the baseball diamond. On the left side. So They say if a Mini Van parks there and you stay in it all night a guy will show up in all black with a gun. And disappear. The guy stole the single moms car and then blown it up. With the kids still in the back sleeping.
