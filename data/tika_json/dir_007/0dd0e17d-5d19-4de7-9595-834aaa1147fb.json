It all started in 1778 when Mr. Begjaine was killed at fort Ticonderoga. Mrs. Begjaine moved her three kids to a mansion in Hauppauge. Shortly after the move a man with an English accent came to the front door saying he wanted to sell some hats. When Mrs. Begjaine let him in he pulled out a gun and killed the whole family. To this day the cops are still investigating the crime. Neighbors complain of strange noises and gunshots coming from the old abandoned house at night. Most of the cops go in but few have lived to come out.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.08", "longitude_y": "-73.7562", "state_abbrev": "NY", "city_latitude": "40.8256536", "begin_civil_twilight": "03:41  ST", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "NY", "sunrise": "04:17  ST", "median drinks per binge": "5.4", "number_of_tribes": "2.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.4", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "67.2", "latitude_x": "40.8213604", "under 21 death percentage": "2.03", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "usgs_region": "Northeast", "sun_upper_transit": "11:56  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "New York", "taxpayer cost": "16330000000.0", "hp_day": "1778/07/01", "moonset": "16:10  ST", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "4", "location": "Begjaine House", "longitude": "-73.20812699999999", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "17.6", "sunset": "19:36  ST", "robbery": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.3780718336483932", "city_longitude": "-73.2026138", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "63.3", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
