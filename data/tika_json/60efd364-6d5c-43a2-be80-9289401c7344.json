An investigator was walking along the trail playing with the his new Digital Voice Recorder and got an EVP right ware the path starts. The EVP clearly states \"SHUTUP!!!\" which was funny. A week later he was walking along the path, and he got to the same part. He went into his pocket to get his recorder out again and he felt what he described as a fist punching him in the stomach. He doubled over in pain just to get out of there. Whatever is there seems to be very selective; not everybody gets results. EVPs of growls like a trapped animal on that same part of the trail have been recorded at different times.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.81", "moon_upper_transit": "09:33  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "1.1342155009451798", "state_abbrev": "OR", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:48  DT", "city_latitude": "45.4312294", "state_y": "OR", "sunrise": "05:26  DT", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "binge drinking (%)": "17.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "89.3", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:14  DT", "latitude_x": "45.4360137", "resident_population_density": "", "median binges monthly": "1.7", "usgs_region": "Northwest", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Oregon", "taxpayer cost": "3520000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "17:12  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "2186.0", "witness_count": "2", "latitude_y": "44.9429", "longitude": "-122.7854995", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "6.0", "sunset": "21:02  DT", "robbery": "", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-122.7714861", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "68.3", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
