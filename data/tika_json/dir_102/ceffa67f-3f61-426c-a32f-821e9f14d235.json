Once in the house, a sense of negative energy can be felt. Spend time in the house and you will see and sense things. Dogs and cats will run from or refuse to enter certain rooms at different times. Heavily lined drapes will blow on a windless day with the windows shut like they were fine linen on a windy day. Heavy person-less footsteps on the wooden stairs can be heard. Door-knobs will turn violently. Faint voices and moving objects and opening and closing doors on their own. Knocks on bedroom doors late at night when no one is there if you open the door. A sense of relief can be felt when pulling away from the house.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.3", "moon_upper_transit": "15:59  DT", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.1890359168241966", "city_latitude": "40.3284402", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:57  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "NJ", "sun_upper_transit": "13:01  DT", "state_abbrev": "NJ", "binge drinking (%)": "14.4", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "82.6", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "273.0", "male death percentage": "34.0", "latitude_x": "40.3285623", "under 21 death percentage": "2.23", "usgs_region": "Northeast", "quarter": "3", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "New Jersey", "taxpayer cost": "6175000000.0", "hp_day": "2023/07/03", "moonset": "23:29  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "9", "location": "Old Farmhouse on Main Street", "longitude": "-74.79087190000001", "latitude_y": "40.2206", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "1.0", "sunset": "20:32  DT", "median binges monthly": "", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-74.790718", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "54.8", "rape/sexual assault": "40.0", "robbery": "52.0"}
