Keller, principal from January 1985 - June 1992, learned of strange happenings when he arrived for duty - lights going off for no reason during the day and strange things at night.\u00a0 Teachers working late or at night would have feelings that someone was watching them, strange rapping sounds, and one teacher saw an apparition of a man. Mr. Keller wrote a ghost story called, \"Jake, The Ghost\", as a Halloween story for the children, teachers, and staff in 1985.\u00a0 The story brought forth more reports of strange behavior from the staff.\u00a0 One teacher working late one evening heard scuffing footsteps coming down the hall toward her classroom. When she investigated she saw nothing but the steps were still coming toward her!\u00a0 She was so scared she climbed out the window, ran across the street to one of the neighbors and called her husband for help!\u00a0 It was not until the summer of 2006 Mr. Keller learned the identity of the ghost. He is a writer of children's poems and stories and wanted further research on his story of the ghost.\u00a0 In September 1903 there was a Chinese race riot.\u00a0 The local labor union for some reason decided to run all the Chinese people out of town.\u00a0 During the riot a Chinese man by the name of Ping Ling was badly beaten and hit over the right eye with a hatchet.\u00a0 He decided to walk out of town and leave the area.\u00a0 He bled to death on the road. That road now is the same one that is between Silver Rim School and the Mormon LDS Church. Silver Rim School was not built until 1980. Where the ghost of Ping Ling was until that time is uncertain. Why he chose to take up residence of the school is another mystery. Mr. Keller is certain Ping Ling means no harm to the people in the building.\u00a0 He is not seen or heard during the day when there are activities in the school. But at night he is quite active and curious. However, Mr. Keller made many trips back to the school at night, especially during the winter, to check security and the heating system. He never encountered Ping Ling on any of his trips. He could only surmise Ping Ling respected him.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.01", "moon_upper_transit": "08:39  ST", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "3.213610586011342", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:00  ST", "city_latitude": "38.069211", "state_y": "NV", "state_x": "Nevada", "state_abbrev": "NV", "number_of_tribes": "17.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.6", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "39.1638", "latitude_x": "38.0843774", "under 21 death percentage": "2.39", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "usgs_region": "Pacific", "sun_upper_transit": "12:00  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "2296000000.0", "hp_day": "1903/01/01", "moonset": "15:39  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "longitude": "-117.2425833", "time_of_day": "Evening", "binge drinking (%)": "16.0", "sunset": "19:28  ST", "robbery": "", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-117.2305861", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "61.5", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
