There have been at least two murders/bodies found in there. In the early 90s, the middle aged female victim of a brutal joy-ride rape-murder was found dumped near the entrance of the reserve (note: the case was hushed by local officials, inexplicably, couldn\u2019t find out even the victims name...the case has never been solved). 4 years ago, another female corpse was found near the lake/dam area, within a small cove, also a nighttime lovers lane - party spot for teen urchins. The dam nearby is the same one where a woman has been seen (dragging a body) in the past.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.78", "moon_upper_transit": "12:01  DT", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.1890359168241966", "resident_population": "6187358.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:17  DT", "city_latitude": "37.3212714", "state_y": "VA", "state_x": "Virginia", "state_abbrev": "VA", "binge drinking (%)": "16.4", "resident_population_density_rank": "17.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "15.7", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "37.5407", "latitude_x": "37.46744839999999", "resident_population_density": "156.7", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "usgs_region": "Northeast", "sun_upper_transit": "13:11  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "6126000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "19:52  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "2", "location": "Amelia Wildlife Reserve", "longitude": "-77.9110321", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "time_of_day": "Morning", "number_of_tribes": "1.0", "sunset": "20:34  DT", "robbery": "", "hp_day": "1990/01/01", "city_longitude": "-77.973865", "personal theft/larceny": "", "chronic death percentage": "57.1", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
