He smiled at me and waved and I told my fianc\u00e9e to take a picture. We thought it was great they put on a show with men dressed the part like soldiers of the war. As we left, we told the keeper what a great idea that was. He didn't know what we were talking about; telling us no one sits in any of the planes. We ran back to look again but there was no one there. When the pictures were developed, there was only a bright light where the man was sitting, as if the sun reflected off the window.\u201d - May 2004 Additional information: this area is no longer accessible to the public.
