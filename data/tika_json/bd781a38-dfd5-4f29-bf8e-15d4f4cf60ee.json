In the late 1800's a beautiful daughter of an Indian chief married a strong warrior. They were madly in love but the warrior, like many of the Indian men did, had to go off in hunting parties. These hunting parties would go on for at least 6 months. When the party finally came back her husband did not come back, he had died along the way home. She, who was heartbroken, went to the top of the cliff that is right at the entrance of the park, and jumped off into the water bellow. Now the water falling from the cliff is only in little drops, like tears. At night, and on a quiet day, you can hear a woman cry, and several other people, presumed to be the crying of the loved ones she left behind. Only on full moons, whether you're standing at the bottom of the cliff, or on the lake looking on from a boat, you can see a woman at the top of the cliff looking down crying, she never seems to realize other people are around her. Often she jumps off, freighting the onlookers who think a mortal has just jumped. When people see this the go to the cliff to try and help the mysterious lady, but when the get there no one is there. Recently while 3 men were hiking at night, they claimed to see a woman walking in front of the crying. When one of the men, who was of Indian descent, went to approach her she hugged him, and started speaking to him in her native tongue. Since he could not understand her he just shook his head. She ran off crying when he did not converse with her. The 3 men, now intrigued, followed her, while she ran to the cliff and jumped off. The three men were terrified, not because she jumped but because she disappeared in mid-air.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.47", "longitude_y": "-92.1735", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "state_abbrev": "MO", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:12  ST", "city_latitude": "38.6608855", "state_y": "", "sunrise": "04:44  ST", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "binge drinking (%)": "18.9", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "80.2", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:10  ST", "latitude_x": "38.7262223", "under 21 death percentage": "3.72", "usgs_region": "", "quarter": "4", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Missouri", "taxpayer cost": "4604000000.0", "hp_day": "1889/12/31", "moonset": "13:30  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "3", "location": "Creve Coeur Park", "longitude": "-90.4854635", "latitude_y": "38.5767", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "19:36  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-90.422618", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "52.5", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
