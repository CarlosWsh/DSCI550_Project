Students have seen the ghost on several occasions. The fourth floor also exhibits inexplicable cold spots and mild poltergeist activity. Students constantly hear footsteps moving around above them in a vacant attic. A student who lives near the attic stairwell said she felt someone grabbing her arm and her room seems to always be cold. According to legend there are 5 spirits in the building. One of which (the most active) was a female college student who lived in the 1800's. She committed suicide after her boyfriend left her when he found out she was pregnant.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.13", "moon_upper_transit": "06:45  ST", "city_latitude": "43.67953139999999", "begin_civil_twilight": "03:18  ST", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "ME", "sunrise": "03:55  ST", "median drinks per binge": "5.4", "binge drinking (%)": "19.5", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "88.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "44.307", "latitude_x": "43.6825395", "under 21 death percentage": "1.68", "usgs_region": "Northeast", "sun_upper_transit": "11:41  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Maine", "taxpayer cost": "938700000.0", "hp_day": "1900/12/31", "moonset": "13:49  ST", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "5", "state_abbrev": "ME", "longitude": "-70.448804", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "time_of_day": "Morning", "number_of_tribes": "1.0", "sunset": "19:26  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.1890359168241966", "city_longitude": "-70.44422519999999", "quarter": "4", "chronic death percentage": "61.5", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
