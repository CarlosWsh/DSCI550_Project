Clay, one of his daughters, one of his sons, and a black servant, haunt the mansion. There have been sightings of Master Clay passing back and forth in front of the top middle window (the nursery), waiting for his ex-wife and children to return. -  June 2005 Update: The Curator at White Hall State Historic Site reports: It is possible that a daughter and son are at White Hall, as numerous incidents site a woman and a little boy. A baby most certainly resides in the mansion. On two separate occasions, in two different seasons, tour guides have heard a baby laughing. Another guide had a small child on her tour remark about seeing babies in the house. The story of Clay passing before the \"top middle window\" (which, incidentally is the third floor hallway, and not a nursery) is a story that the works say they never heard of or experienced at this site. It is doubtful that Cassius would have waited for his ex-wife and children, more likely they would be waiting for him, as he spent a great deal of time away from home campaigning, fighting in the Mexican War, as ambassador to Russia, and in general making a spectacle of himself. In addition to sightings of a lady (although we call her \"the lady in black,\" she is rather stylish and tends to change her clothes, the Curator\u2019s husband has seen her in blue), music has been heard in the mansion (of the piano and music box variety) as well as footsteps. At times one can also smell candles, perfume, apple pie, bourbon and bacon.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.19", "moon_upper_transit": "09:54  DT", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_latitude": "37.7478572", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:45  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Kentucky", "median drinks per binge": "5.7", "binge drinking (%)": "15.8", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.7", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "38.1868", "latitude_x": "37.8332101", "under 21 death percentage": "2.67", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:41  DT", "city_sunrise": "5:13 am", "taxpayer cost": "3195000000.0", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "moonset": "17:12  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "4", "state_abbrev": "KY", "longitude": "-84.3526553", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "21:06  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-84.2946539", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "53.5", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
