In fact, up in the Brigham City Valley, there is a \"B\" on the Mountain for Box Elder and though faded, the \"I\" is still present as well. the school also served as a Hospital for wounded soldiers during WWII. As a precautionary measure there were many underground tunnels that were built to support the likes of an evacuation. Today many of the buildings have been remade into apartment housing and also are rented out as storage, but some are still closed to the public and are not being used for anything. The tunnels were boarded up at the end of the war. Today the buildings not in use stand deserted and boarded up. Kids from the area go inside sort of like a dare. Upon one of these instances it was discovered that the tunnels that were once boarded up now stand open to those daring enough to go inside. One of the rooms you can get to by use of the tunnels has been used for satanic rituals. Blood hangs on the walls; there is a pot in the corner and an \"alter\" in the middle of the room. Another room has paintings of demonic clowns with knives and other sharp objects painted on the walls. there have been speakers and lecturers brought in to speak on the subject at the college. One speaker said that Northern Utah was 2nd in the nation among Satan worshiping among teenagers. It is verified by police there is some sort of human activity and they warn not to go up there.
