The one left hallway in the nursing home's main floor is the only place that seems to be haunted. Items in rooms being thrown everywhere, noises coming from places. Once a nurse walked into a patients room and left, and a few minutes later came back in, and the patient she was treating said \"where did that Indian boy go that was following you?\". Also, one time a patient in a room seemed to be being suffocated, and her other roommate rang the call bell and the nurses came in and she suddenly stopped being suffocated. The patient said she saw a character like the \"grim reaper\" over her strangling her. The next day, bruises appeared on her neck in the shape on hands. Presences are felt in this hospital.
