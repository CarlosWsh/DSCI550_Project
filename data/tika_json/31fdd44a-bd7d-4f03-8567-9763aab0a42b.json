About 20 years ago, there was a guy that used to help out at the bar and sleep in his car in the back parking lot. This guy unfortunately had a drug problem though, and was found one evening by the dumpster in the back close to death, having OD'd. He was dragged inside the bar and passed on there. There is a very strong sense that someone is watching over your shoulder, and not in a good way. Also he likes to mess with the electricity, doors, he gets a little loud upstairs, and makes all the employees feel very uncomfortable. He also will mess with the juke box.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.69", "longitude_y": "-97.7431", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_latitude": "26.1118401", "begin_civil_twilight": "06:02  DT", "resident_population": "16986510.0", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Texas", "state_abbrev": "TX", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "31.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.9", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "19.4", "simple assault": "548.0", "latitude_y": "30.2672", "latitude_x": "27.7022112", "resident_population_density": "65.0", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:33  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "18821000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "07:28  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "1", "median drinks per binge": "5.6", "longitude": "-97.3602579", "curphase": "Waning Gibbous", "time_of_day": "Evening", "binge drinking (%)": "17.6", "sunset": "20:36  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "1997/03/16", "city_longitude": "-97.1681257", "quarter": "1", "chronic death percentage": "56.9", "rape/sexual assault": "39.0", "robbery": "93.0"}
