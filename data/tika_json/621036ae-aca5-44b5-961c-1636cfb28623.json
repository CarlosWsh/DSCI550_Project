Apparently a stable hand died in the barn (now used as the park office). staff has shut off lights and closed doors only to find them on or open when they come back a few hours later, but nothing much more than that. One witness reports he was going to his car from the beach at what is called \"Suicide Hill\" and saw two little girls walking up the path towards him. They vanished as he got closer. A guy who works there confirmed one of his ex-coworkers saw the same girls and heard giggling in the woods in that area. Supposedly two young sisters drowned in the waters off the point back in the 70's.
