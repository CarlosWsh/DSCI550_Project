In the early 1900's the building was the location of several executions by hanging. In 1984, 911 dispatchers in what was then the 911 dispatch center saw the transparent image of the lower part of a man hanging on a video security monitor. The camera was pointing toward the hallway in the upper parking level, leading from the magistrate's office toward the delivery garage area. When they went to the area to investigate the image on the security monitor, they saw nothing; however, they felt coldness in the area, and were seen to pass through the image on the camera as they checked the area. Later research in the historical society revealed that the hangings were conducted on the second floor on the prison building, which would locate it in the area now known as upper parking in the new building, in that part of the office building near the intersection of Pittsburgh St. and Pennsylvania Ave.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.59", "moon_upper_transit": "07:15  ST", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_latitude": "40.3014581", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:04  ST", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Pennsylvania", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.7", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "69.0", "latitude_x": "40.3026716", "under 21 death percentage": "2.67", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:09  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "9544000000.0", "hp_day": "1900/01/01", "moonset": "14:12  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "2", "state_abbrev": "PA", "longitude": "-79.5447136", "latitude_y": "40.2732", "time_of_day": "Morning", "binge drinking (%)": "18.5", "sunset": "19:40  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-79.5389289", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "52.4", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
