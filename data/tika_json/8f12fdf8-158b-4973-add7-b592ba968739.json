On the other end of the building is a deep, ruined bomb shelter from the early 40s ar 50s. In the basement is a very negative feeling, very hard to describe. It is usually locked, but occasionally residents break in and wander around. It is mild there though. The bomb shelter has been locked for years but last year was broken into. Recently we discovered what appears to be a false wall in there, because the lining on the wall ends (no one noticed before because of the lighting and the junk all over the floor).. The negative feeling from the basement is present in the bomb shelter too, but grows as you near the false wall. Dorm residents are curious to explore but don't want to get caught. No one knows any specific stories, but we all speculate it would have to deal with someone dying in one fo the hospitalrooms. No ideas about what's behind the false wall, though. - Febuary 2005 Correction:there was never a morgue. The first floor of the original wing was the campus clinic which did have a couple of overnight observation rooms, but the city hospital was (and still is) less than half a mile away and the campus clinic was never used for long term care. The clinic closed when the \"short wing\" was built in the 60's, and the clinic was renovated into rooms (which is why those rooms resemble the short wing rooms more than the rooms above. The false wall in the bomb shelter and it was a bomb shelter at one time it still had emergency rations (not sure if they are still there) covers an alcolve that to hold air filtration gear. A shaft behind the wall runs into the main basement.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.69", "moon_upper_transit": "00:34  DT", "aggravated assault": "94.0", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "20851820.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "06:02  DT", "city_latitude": "31.6035129", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Texas", "state_abbrev": "TX", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "30.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.9", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "22.8", "simple assault": "228.0", "latitude_y": "30.2672", "latitude_x": "31.6219236", "under 21 death percentage": "3.97", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:33  DT", "city_sunrise": "5:24 am", "taxpayer cost": "18821000000.0", "hp_day": "2005/02/20", "moonset": "05:35  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "", "median drinks per binge": "5.6", "longitude": "-94.6462581", "curphase": "Full Moon", "time_of_day": "Morning", "binge drinking (%)": "17.6", "sunset": "20:36  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-94.6554874", "quarter": "1", "chronic death percentage": "56.9", "rape/sexual assault": "11.0", "robbery": "37.0"}
