There are several stories about this spooky area. There are three bridges supposedly haunted by the ghost of a school bus driver named George, who committed suicide after a boy was killed in an accident involving his bus; if you stop on the third bridge and say his name three times, your car doors will lock and he will appear (there are several variations). The road also forks, diverging into the \"Light Path\" and the \"Dark Path\". Apparently the Dark Path has been the site of more than one teenage suicide. Also surrounding the area are several old stone buildings which,may possibily have been used to be some kind of waterworks, now abandoned.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.08", "location": "Jaquin's Pond", "moon_upper_transit": "09:08  DT", "city_latitude": "42.0208501", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:42  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "NY", "sunrise": "05:17  DT", "state_abbrev": "NY", "number_of_tribes": "2.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.4", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:57  DT", "latitude_x": "42.013347", "under 21 death percentage": "2.03", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "usgs_region": "Northeast", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "New York", "taxpayer cost": "16330000000.0", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "moonset": "16:37  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "6701.0", "witness_count": "1", "median drinks per binge": "5.4", "longitude": "-79.5905435", "latitude_y": "42.6526", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "17.6", "sunset": "20:37  DT", "robbery": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.3780718336483932", "city_longitude": "-79.6299617", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "63.3", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
