Most kids were told the ghost stories of Old Colemine Road. One is that a little boy who lived in a nearby farmhouse was riding his tricycle out on the road and was hit and killed by a passing truck. It is said that when the moon is full, you can see the little boy on his tricyle for a few seconds and then he fades away. Another tale is that of a man who had been drinking and was walking home along the country road. He was beaten and robbed and left to die. His ghost haunts the old bridge where his body was found, seeking justice. The old bridge is no longer in use, it has been neglected for a newer safer bridge, but its remnants remain. there is a dead-end gravel road off of Jarboe. The submitter to this post can not remember the name of the road, but if you take that road it will lead you to an old bridge. Sometimes you get uneasy feelings like someone was watching us-always from the west side of the bridge.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.47", "longitude_y": "-92.1735", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:13  DT", "city_latitude": "39.7844687", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Missouri", "state_abbrev": "MO", "binge drinking (%)": "18.9", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "80.2", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "70.5", "latitude_x": "", "under 21 death percentage": "3.72", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:11  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "4604000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:44  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "", "location": "Old Colemine Rd. \u2013 Aka Jarboe Road", "longitude": "", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:37  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_longitude": "-93.0735348", "personal theft/larceny": "", "chronic death percentage": "52.5", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
