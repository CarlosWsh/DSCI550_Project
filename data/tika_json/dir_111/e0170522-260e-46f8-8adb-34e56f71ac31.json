A local historian reported visiting the house once and being greeted at the front door by a \"strange-looking\" woman. She told him, without being asked, that no one was home and closed the door. He knocked for several more minutes and was about to leave when the owners pulled in. Upon relating the story to the owner, they all checked the house thoroughly, and never found her.
