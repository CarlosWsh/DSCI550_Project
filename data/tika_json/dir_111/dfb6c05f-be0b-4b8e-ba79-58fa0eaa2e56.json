Back in the 1940's a young couple was traveling into town, back from their honeymoon. The car went off the side of the road into a ditch and the man told his wife to stay by the car while he walked into town for help. When he came back, his wife was nowhere to be seen and now her ghost haunts the road and any passenger who travels it. Certain places will have thick pockets of fog and several townies have had spooky encounters with this young lady, who they have dubbed, \"The White Lady.\" Her car is still located on the side of the road, down in the ditch, on its roof, untouched.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.13", "year": "1940", "moon_upper_transit": "00:47  ST", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.7561436672967864", "resident_population": "847226.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "03:18  ST", "city_latitude": "45.6572639", "state_y": "ME", "sun_upper_transit": "11:41  ST", "median drinks per binge": "5.4", "binge drinking (%)": "19.5", "resident_population_density_rank": "36.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "88.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "6.2", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "44.307", "latitude_x": "45.4389003", "resident_population_density": "27.5", "usgs_region": "Northwest", "curphase": "Waning Gibbous", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Maine", "taxpayer cost": "938700000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "05:47  ST", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "2", "state_abbrev": "ME", "longitude": "-69.0317323", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "4.0", "sunset": "19:27  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "1940/07/01", "city_longitude": "-68.70981189999999", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "61.5", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
