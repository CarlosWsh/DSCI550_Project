This is an old hospital built in the early 1950`s and as a result tends to have a lot of sightings. Nurses will tell you that they will hear the sound of a baby crying a day before a baby will be delivered. There have been numerous times night shift staff will see ghosts out of the corner of their eye only to disappear when they turn to get a better look. Beds have raised and lowered by themselves without anyone at the helm operating the bed. Linen closet doors would open on their own as one would pass by. When the hospital first opened nuns operated it and would cook brownies for the patients. The nuns are long gone and do not work in the hospital any more, however their have been several sightings of the nuns cooking in the little kitchen area in the hall on the second floor. Also once in a while the smell of brownies cooking can be detected, but no one is cooking! A new hospital is scheduled to be built soon.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.74", "moon_upper_transit": "17:12  ST", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "state_abbrev": "NM", "city_latitude": "33.1284047", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:18  ST", "resident_population": "681187.0", "state_y": "", "state_x": "New Mexico", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "48.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.6", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "28.1", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "70.6", "latitude_x": "33.1402658", "resident_population_density": "5.6", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:05  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "2233000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "23:39  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "7", "latitude_y": "35.6822", "longitude": "-107.2418894", "time_of_day": "Morning", "binge drinking (%)": "15.6", "sunset": "19:23  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "1950/01/01", "city_longitude": "-107.2528069", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "61.2", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
