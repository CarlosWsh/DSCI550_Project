Rumor has it that he will try to get in the car with you. If you let him in, he'll ask you to take him to that White Horse. He will tell you how hard he works and how little you work. His hands are green from never wearing any gloves. Some people say he has asked to see their hands. If you show him your hands, he will say, \"Them's woman's hands!!\" The scariest part of this site is, he is real. He is not a ghost.
