While many have patients have hanged themselves in the trees throughout the 44 acres, some have committed suicide in the underground tunnels. It is down there that moans and groans can be clearly heard. It is not uncommon to hear footsteps either approaching you or walking away from you while in the long tunnels, however, no one can be seen. You may also hear the wheels of linen carts being pushed in the tunnels but never seen. In some areas you may feel the presence of someone or something touching you.
