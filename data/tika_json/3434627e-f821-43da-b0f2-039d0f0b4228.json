It is said by some faculty and former students that high up, normally on the 2nd to 3rd floor of the new dormitory, you can vaguely see him hanging there from the rope tied to the ceiling in the later hours of the night. You can also see him sitting out in the lawn writing in his book of poetry. - December 2003 update: monitors will turn on/off for no reason, the blinds will shake, the doors on the closet will shake, the door entering our room will be knocked on but nobody will be there to have knocked on it, and there is often a lot of commotion in our bathroom.
