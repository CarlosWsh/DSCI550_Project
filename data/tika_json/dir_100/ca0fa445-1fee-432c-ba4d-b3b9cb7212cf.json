No indication of German ghosts, as the P.O.W.s were very well treated. However, the Photo Building is haunted. Most activity occurs at night or after hours, when the building is quiet. There is a long history of this building being haunted, going back 30 years or more. The haunting is not harmful, just unsettling. Running feet, indistinct whispering, unintelligible talking at a distance and footsteps are heard. No reports of missing or moving objects. A few instances of very loud crashes, like a wall full of items fell to the floor. Upon investigation, nothing is found. One photographer saw a fleeting figure run out of the old developing room, across the hallway and into a cinder block wall. Figure was tall, black pants, white shirt and dark hair. Matches description of a photographer who died of natural causes at home years ago. Speculation that he's back, because he enjoyed working there so much. All activity occurs in the front half of the building, which is the oldest. An addition was built in the early 1980s, doubling the size of the building. No activity reported in this new addition. The older, front portion of the building is scheduled to be refurbished in the near future. This will mean tearing out some walls, redoing the rooms and a major makeover. How this will affect the current strange activity remains unknown.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.7", "location": "Photo Building at Ditto Area", "longitude_y": "-111.891", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "890627.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:23  ST", "city_latitude": "40.22105320000001", "state_y": "", "sunrise": "04:56  ST", "median drinks per binge": "5.6", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "44.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "79.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "29.3", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:29  ST", "latitude_x": "", "resident_population_density": "10.8", "median binges monthly": "1.7", "usgs_region": "", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Utah", "taxpayer cost": "1636000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "17:53  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "3", "state_abbrev": "UT", "longitude": "", "time_of_day": "Morning", "binge drinking (%)": "10.5", "sunset": "20:02  ST", "robbery": "", "hp_day": "1960/01/01", "city_longitude": "-112.7444097", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "47.8", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
