You can hear doors slam, and at night, it has been told that you can see red or green lights that are shaped like eyes. It has also been told that on a certain Saturday of the month, if you drive three circles around this church at a specific time, you will see nothing around you, every thing seems to disappear momentarily. All of the windows and doors are boarded, but they still have services here but only on Sunday morning.
