Her body was later discovered and her killer was never caught. Late at night the sound of a bicycle can be heard around the 5 Mile Drive. Several years later a couple flagged down a Park Police officer and admitted she had been driving on the drive after the park was closed. She said as she was rounding the turn by the Narrows viewpoint, she observed a young girl standing next to the side of the road with a light colored bicycle. She pulled over and her boyfriend got out to ask the girl if she was okay, since it was late and the park was closed. The boyfriend screamed and jumped back in the car and kept screaming at her to go. As she was leaving, in the red tail lamp glow, she saw the girl vanish. The boyfriend was shaking and later told her the girl had no eyes but was smiling at him. Several other people have said that they have seen a girl riding alone near dusk and whenever they stop or look back at her, she vanishes.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.01", "moon_upper_transit": "09:32  DT", "state_abbrev": "WA", "city_latitude": "47.2528768", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:37  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "WA", "state_x": "Washington", "median drinks per binge": "5.3", "binge drinking (%)": "15.4", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "87.2", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "66.0", "latitude_x": "47.3083123", "resident_population_density": "", "usgs_region": "Northwest", "sun_upper_transit": "13:14  DT", "city_sunrise": "5:07 am", "taxpayer cost": "5805000000.0", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "moonset": "17:19  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "7", "latitude_y": "47.0379", "longitude": "-122.5327736", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "time_of_day": "Evening", "number_of_tribes": "30.0", "sunset": "21:11  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.5", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "5.671077504725898", "city_longitude": "-122.4442906", "quarter": "1", "chronic death percentage": "64.6", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
