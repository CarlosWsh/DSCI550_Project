Due to the difficult terrain, students lived on campus. In the flood of 1939, many students and staff perished while holing up in the boiler room. (They were warned of a tornado, not flood). Little remains of the school after the flood. Buildings include a dorm, a gym and a stone chapel. It has been reported that sounds of children laughing and crying can be heard. It is also reported that heat can be felt coming from the \"punishment rooms\". You can go there and feel like you are being watched, the laughter of little kids and in the third building you can feel heat as you go up the stairs to the punishment rooms. Some have even seen red glowing eyes in the upstairs. There is also what seems to be a small chapel that has an aboveground basement that sits out in a field. The basement is filled with black mud like substance. If viewed from above it has a whirlpool design to it. Several people say that they have heard cries of young children and have even seen them. It has been said that you will see and hear terrifying things. - December 2006 Update \u2013 has been torn down.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.19", "moon_upper_transit": "10:03  DT", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "state_abbrev": "KY", "city_latitude": "37.5359616", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:45  DT", "resident_population": "4041769.0", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Kentucky", "median drinks per binge": "5.7", "binge drinking (%)": "15.8", "resident_population_density_rank": "25.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.7", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "9.7", "simple assault": "289.0", "male death percentage": "70.6", "latitude_x": "37.7491841", "under 21 death percentage": "2.67", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:41  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "3195000000.0", "hp_day": "2006/12/20", "moonset": "17:21  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "4", "latitude_y": "38.1868", "longitude": "-83.07121269999999", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "21:06  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-83.33618799999999", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "53.5", "rape/sexual assault": "25.0", "robbery": "51.0"}
