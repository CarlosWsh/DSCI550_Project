It was built in the 1920's with funds donated by the Grunow family, supposedly as a memorial to their young daughter, who drowned in the lake right behind where the theatre stands. Sometimes, usually late at night during rehearsals when there are only a few people are around, strange noises and giggling are heard. Lights become unplugged, things move or disappear.
