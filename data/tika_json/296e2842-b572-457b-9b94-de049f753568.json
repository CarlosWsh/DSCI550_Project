The first one started in the projection room. I don't know where the second one started. There used to be a hotel in the exact spot where the theater is. In 1977-1979(I'm not sure what year) the hotel was burnt down with almost everyone dead including the man who started the fire. Some people in Breckinridge think that his spirit started the fires in the theater. Some people have claimed that they saw a transparent man wandering the halls during the movie, including some employees.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.35", "moon_upper_transit": "17:10  DT", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "1.3232514177693762", "state_abbrev": "MN", "resident_population": "3804971.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:48  DT", "city_latitude": "46.26277779999999", "state_y": "MN", "state_x": "Minnesota", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "binge drinking (%)": "21.7", "resident_population_density_rank": "33.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "87.3", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "11.5", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:14  DT", "latitude_x": "46.263414", "under 21 death percentage": "2.31", "usgs_region": "Midwest", "quarter": "3", "city_sunrise": "5:07 am", "taxpayer cost": "3886000000.0", "hp_day": "1977/07/01", "moonset": "23:51  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "2", "location": "Cinema 6 Theater", "longitude": "-96.590177", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "7.0", "sunset": "21:02  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.5", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-96.5869443", "personal theft/larceny": "", "chronic death percentage": "65.2", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
