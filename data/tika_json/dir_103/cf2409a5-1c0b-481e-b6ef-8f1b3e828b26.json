A young airman hung himself during training in the wing. Now strange things happen in the wings surrounding that wing. The wing was closed for a year but then an overflow of students came and the wing was reopened. It was part of the male dormitories. All that had gone down that hall said that the lights flickered and it was very cold. The room was located at the end of the hall next to the window and on the right. The bed it happened in was on the right. The two male airmen that were assigned that room was not informed of what happened. Strange things started happening to the one in the right bed. He almost became possessed by this spirit. The airmen in the left bed once woke up with his roommate standing over him. Another night he awoke because he could not breath and found that his covers were wrapped around his neck. He went to the red rope for help, and shortly after the wing was once again shut down. The Chaplin came in and performed an exorcism. Then about a year to two years later the dormitory was torn down.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.77", "longitude_y": "-90.1848", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.1890359168241966", "state_abbrev": "MS", "city_latitude": "30.3960318", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:26  DT", "resident_population": "2178141.0", "state_y": "MS", "state_x": "Mississippi", "median drinks per binge": "5.7", "number_of_tribes": "1.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "31.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.2", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "0.0", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "71.9", "latitude_x": "30.4094159", "under 21 death percentage": "3.94", "usgs_region": "Southeast", "sun_upper_transit": "13:02  DT", "city_sunrise": "5:01 am", "taxpayer cost": "2277000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "00:10  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "2", "latitude_y": "32.2988", "longitude": "-88.9252664", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "13.7", "sunset": "20:11  DT", "median binges monthly": "2.1", "hp_day": "1969/12/31", "city_longitude": "-88.88530779999999", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "52.3", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
