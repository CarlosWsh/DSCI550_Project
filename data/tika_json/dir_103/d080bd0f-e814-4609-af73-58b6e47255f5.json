It is housed in an old building circa 1890, which was the original mercantile for Riverside. Objects move on their own accord and sometimes disappear only to reappear later in a different spot. There is sometimes a strong scent of perfume. A lady who had a shop at this location died violently in a car jacking in the mid 1990's and some say that it is her spirit, although it is an old building. When asked about this the staff will usually laugh a bit and tell you of a personal experience.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.29", "moon_upper_transit": "15:43  ST", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "16.824196597353495", "state_abbrev": "CA", "city_latitude": "33.9533487", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:10  ST", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "CA", "sun_upper_transit": "12:07  ST", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "binge drinking (%)": "16.6", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "69.1", "latitude_x": "33.926153", "under 21 death percentage": "2.49", "usgs_region": "Pacific", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "city_sunrise": "4:54 am", "state_x": "California", "taxpayer cost": "35011000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "22:55  ST", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "15443.0", "witness_count": "", "latitude_y": "38.575764", "longitude": "-117.437132", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "89.0", "sunset": "19:33  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "hp_day": "1890/07/01", "city_longitude": "-117.3961564", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "64.4", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
