Rumor has it that a family died in the fire, and people have felt cold chills when passing by the house. - June 2008 Update / Correction: The house was burned by some kids partying inside in the late 90's. Prior to being burned, it was rumored to have been haunted by the family. The rumor was the family's daughter was insane so they kept her locked in her room. A report from a witness to seeing the house before the fire reports that in the house prior to being burned down. The room had bars on the windows (the windows for this room were the only ones on the house with bars). Inside the room had clasps so the room could be locked from the outside of the room. The room was recessed and the steps had been removed so there was a pretty good drop from the door to the inside of the room. All the contents were still in the house, as if after the family was murdered none entered the house again. Dirty dishes in the sink, a book was opened and set upside down next to a chair in the living room area, etc. The rumor is the girl escaped and killed her mother and father then disappeared.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.47", "longitude_y": "-92.1735", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_latitude": "36.6436731", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:13  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Missouri", "state_abbrev": "MO", "binge drinking (%)": "18.9", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "80.2", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "70.5", "latitude_x": "36.694502", "under 21 death percentage": "3.72", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:11  DT", "city_sunrise": "5:17 am", "taxpayer cost": "4604000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:44  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "1", "location": "Sycamore Church Road", "longitude": "-93.2751263", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:37  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-93.2185144", "personal theft/larceny": "", "chronic death percentage": "52.5", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
