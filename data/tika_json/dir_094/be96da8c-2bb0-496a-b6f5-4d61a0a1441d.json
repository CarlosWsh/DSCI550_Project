It was called a suicide, but the water was only 4 feet deep at the deepest spot where this woman was found. There is also a graveyard that runs along side the edge of the gorge of this creek. There have been stories of a woman ,dressed in black garments of the 1800s alongside the creek,opposite the graveyard, looking right at a person, with a sad expression on her face, and then pointing across the gorge (towards the cemetary) and then disapearing. She has been seen in various areas of this property. In addition, General Sullivan was said to have marched through this area, burning down Native Americans crops along the way, and was said to have buried his cannowith all the soldiers pay somewhere, alongside the creek.
