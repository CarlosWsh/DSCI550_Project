Years ago there was a mental hospital located near Toad road. It is now a deserted building. Hundreds of mental patients are said to have escaped from there and killed in the woods surrounding it. If you travel back to Toad Road, you go through seven gates known to locals as \"The Seven Gates of Hell.\" No one has ever been through the fifth gate. Everyone who makes it to the gates hears noises and sees weird things moving in the woods. - November 2005 Update: It was so popular among local teenagers that just recently, the old hospital and the gates were torn down. One gate stands, the first gate, which is highly visible off of Trout Run Rd. The area is private property, and there are many new no trespassing signs up. Forestry agents are reportedly tearing down trees back there to stop people from coming to experience the \"freakiness\".March 2008 Update \u2013 A resident reports investigating the site extensively states this submission is totally false, there was never an insane asylum there, the metal gate is there, but it belonged to a mansion or house.
