The story is, is that the soldiers were camping by the water whole one night and were attacked on, by Indians. The Indians burned their wagons, stole their horses, and killed all the women and children. And now if you go there at night, you can hear cries of people, also you can here arrows flying by as if shot at you, also on occasion you can see camp fire glows out in the woods. Also a very rare incident occurred there. One night a group of friends were trying the legend out. While all the friends were talking a couple of girls walked off on their own. When the girls were walking back one of the girls noticed that her friend had not said a word while walking she would just nod her head to everything she would say. Then she heard her friends calling her from a distance, but to notice her best friend was not with her, she was with the group of people off at a distance. So she gasped and started to run towards her friends knowing she had been accompanied by an unknown figure, not her friend.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.69", "location": "soldiers water whole", "moon_upper_transit": "09:48  DT", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "06:02  DT", "city_latitude": "31.1351682", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Texas", "state_abbrev": "TX", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.9", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "30.2672", "latitude_x": "", "resident_population_density": "", "usgs_region": "", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "18821000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:49  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "10647.0", "witness_count": "2", "median drinks per binge": "5.6", "longitude": "", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "17.6", "sunset": "20:36  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-99.3350552", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "56.9", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
