(it is said that sometimes there is a noose still hanging there)Though the entire house was set ablaze, only the back wall fell completely burnt, the rest of the house is intact, and many strange occurrences are said to happen there. the mystery of this haunting is that, no one is allowed to approach it at all. If you are seen going anywhere near it, you will be arrested. the old tree is still there, off of Clark road, dead, but still standing with the limb he hung himself on jutting out into the road.
