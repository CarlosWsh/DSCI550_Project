Floor of the building.\u00a0 This is hard to accurately describe, since no one who was working there at the time cares to elaborate on any details from this event, but all that was gathered is that the boy scout leader had apparently gone crazy and killed some of the scouts before being caught.\u00a0 When the building was closed for the winter one year (Gatlinburg is a tourist town which is really only full for the summer and autumn months) an employee was making rounds through the building and stopped on the 7 th.
