When you shut your car off on the bridge or near the church and cemetery, and go to start it again, it makes funny noises. When you sit in the ledge of the bridge, take your shoes off, and dangle your feet above the creek, you can feel a weird tickling feeling on your feet. Myth says it's the slave children drown there tickling your feet. You can see peculiar lights like sets of eyes that blink every now and then, under the bridge, in the trees along the creek, and in the cemetery up on the hill by the creek. Also, if you go out on a dark night, when there has been no running water...in forever, stop your car on the bridge, and roll down your windows, you can hear what sounds like water running in the creek, but also strangely, foot steps in the weeds and leaves. If you stay and hang out for a while, like an hour or more, when you come back to your car, there are what appears to be foot and hand prints on your hood and windshield. - June Update/additional Information - it's said that if you turn your engine off on the bridge that it won't start again. You'll have to push the car off the bridge onto the gravel road to get it to start. The poster tried this once and it started right back up. There's another variation to the story, but it's the same thing as what was submitted about Albino Farm Bridge in Springfield, Mo. There's also the ghost of a woman seen walking on the bridge at night. There may not be any truth in these stories about either place. Of all the people talked to about these places over the years, no one ever says that they themselves have seen anything.
