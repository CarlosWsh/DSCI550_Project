It is the oldest part of the hotel. A woman hung herself in room 209 long ago and often haunts that room. And she often stands by the fireplace in the room across from that known as the Washington room. Also, someone killed a woman in room 315 on the third floor long ago. A man can be seen walking down the hall coming from that direction. Lights will turn on by themselves. - April 2007 Update: The most often reported is the \"lady in the blue hat\" by room 209.
