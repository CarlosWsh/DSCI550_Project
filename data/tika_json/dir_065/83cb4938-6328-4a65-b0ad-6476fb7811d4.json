His shadow is often seen in the lighting box. He is said to be the ghost of one of the men that were working on it when it was being built, he fell off the scaffolding onto the hard cement floor and it killed him instantly, not only does he show up in mirrors but he messes with the lights, and moves the curtains around on the stage. He sometimes says things to people in there as well but it always comes from above the person\u2019s head like he was floating above them. One can never make out what he is saying, its mostly gibberish. Underneath the stage are the caves for like changing during a performances, which is where he looms most of the time, his presence can be felt very easily.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.59", "moon_upper_transit": "18:21  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "11319366.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:05  DT", "city_latitude": "40.9756136", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Pennsylvania", "state_abbrev": "PA", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "9.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.7", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "7.8", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:09  DT", "latitude_x": "40.967416", "under 21 death percentage": "2.67", "usgs_region": "", "quarter": "4", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "9544000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "00:25  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "1", "latitude_y": "40.2732", "longitude": "-78.51803", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "18.5", "sunset": "20:41  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "1969/10/31", "city_longitude": "-78.5250243", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "52.4", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
