His body was stuffed under the staircase. I myself have went here and once I stood by the staircase Half of my body went cold. Also me and my best friend were looking at the bloodstains and we both felt parts of our bodies get cold, as if we were standing over the body itself. There are also 'shades' of Civil War Soldiers and even a woman who only appears at the fish pond at 12 noon. She is seen to be holding a child wrapped in black fabric. People who have stayed in this bed and breakfast have reported sounds of Trumpeters calling soldiers.
