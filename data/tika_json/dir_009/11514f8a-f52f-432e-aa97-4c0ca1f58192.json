Upon reaching the top of the old staircase, the young boy fell from the clock tower and landed on the concrete below. He broke his neck and died instantly. The boys responsible for the crime never confessed until they started experiencing hauntings during school. One was haunted so bad that he committed suicide a year later. The boy's ghost still haunts the clock tower today and can be seen opening the door that leads to it. Students also report that the lights flicker upon opening the door.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.08", "longitude_y": "-73.7562", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "1.1342155009451798", "state_abbrev": "NY", "resident_population": "13479142.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "03:42  ST", "city_latitude": "41.0017643", "state_y": "NY", "sunrise": "04:17  ST", "median drinks per binge": "5.4", "number_of_tribes": "6.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "7.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.4", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "7.1", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "11:57  ST", "latitude_x": "41.0123199", "resident_population_density": "286.0", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "usgs_region": "Northwest", "curphase": "Waning Gibbous", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "New York", "taxpayer cost": "16330000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "06:08  ST", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "2", "latitude_y": "42.6526", "longitude": "-73.6785457", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "binge drinking (%)": "17.6", "sunset": "19:36  ST", "robbery": "", "hp_day": "1940/07/01", "city_longitude": "-73.66568339999999", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "63.3", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
