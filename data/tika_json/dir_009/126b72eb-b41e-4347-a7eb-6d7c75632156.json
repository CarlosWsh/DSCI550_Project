Many men died at sea while fishing leaving their wives and children alone, so they would acquire dogs, once the shoreline was deemed safe they abandoned the \"village\" leaving the dogs behind, creating wild dog packs. There are reports of a begger woman who asks for money at the entrance and curses you if you don't relent. Also a man who was dragged out by police because he went insane looking for the gold pieces the woman hid in her cellar is said to be heard ranting and raving.
