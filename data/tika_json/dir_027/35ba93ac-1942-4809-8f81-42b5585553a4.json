And the husband fell in. It's claimed that she didn't want to live without him. She jumped in too. People have claimed that still today they can see that women and sometimes they see Red light or orbs floating around the spots she died. - Feuary 2005 Update: many people have drowned there but two in particular stand out. In the late 1950's two brothers were swimming at the bottom of the falls when one went out too far and started to sink. The other brother then jumped in to save him but unfortunately both drowned and are seen quite regularly by the staff of the Log cabin.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.08", "moon_upper_transit": "09:08  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "state_abbrev": "NY", "city_latitude": "43.0672811", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:42  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "NY", "state_x": "New York", "median drinks per binge": "5.4", "number_of_tribes": "2.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.4", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:57  DT", "latitude_x": "43.025", "under 21 death percentage": "2.03", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "usgs_region": "Northeast", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "16330000000.0", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "moonset": "16:37  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "4", "latitude_y": "42.6526", "longitude": "-78.39806", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "binge drinking (%)": "17.6", "sunset": "20:37  DT", "robbery": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.3780718336483932", "city_longitude": "-78.3914111", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "63.3", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
