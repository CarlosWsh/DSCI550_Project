With a steel addition to the top of the building, it is now 9 stories tall with another smaller building on top. There are two reported \"hauntings\" in the Fischer Building. In the basement, in the offices of the maintenance staff, there is a tall man that walks from one room, a short distance through a larger room to the next room.? Many people have reported him walking in the same direction, and he has been seen only from the back. On the fourth floor, in the northwest hallway, there is a well dressed woman, wearing a dress, fur and high heels that appears near the center of the building and walks north, turns to the right and goes in the last doorway.? Her style of dress suggests she is from the 1920s or 1930s.? Some people report that she opens the door and enters the last office, even though the door is locked.?", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.15", "moon_upper_transit": "06:50  ST", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.1890359168241966", "city_latitude": "42.5005583", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:06  ST", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "IA", "sun_upper_transit": "12:16  ST", "state_abbrev": "IA", "binge drinking (%)": "24.5", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "88.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "41.5908", "latitude_x": "42.5016445", "under 21 death percentage": "2.45", "usgs_region": "Midwest", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "city_sunrise": "5:04 am", "state_x": "Iowa", "taxpayer cost": "1934000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "12:57  ST", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "2", "location": "Fischer Building", "longitude": "-90.6678969", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "1.0", "sunset": "19:52  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "hp_day": "1870/06/01", "city_longitude": "-90.6645718", "quarter": "2", "chronic death percentage": "67.0", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
