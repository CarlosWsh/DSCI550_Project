These two playful spirits especially enjoy the company of the current owner\u2019s youngest child. Observers have witnessed evidence of these two ghosts when the younger child throws a ball and the ball stops in mid-air and return to her. These two spirits have shared their names with the owner\u2019s youngest child and she will address them by name. They will often bring \"others\" along with them when they come to play. If the owner\u2019s children are not there, these two spirits seem to be unhappy and are more likely to allow others to see them or evidence of them. The owner claims that these presences bring \"charm\" to his establishment and he welcomes everyone to come and take the chance they might have a spooky encounter!
