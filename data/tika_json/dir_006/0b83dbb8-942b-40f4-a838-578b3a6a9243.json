She died when she was barely seventeen of heart failure. Rumor has it that he had her buried under the foundation before the foundation was finished. People who visit the library sometimes see her walking the halls, outlined in bright blue light. At night, passersby both on foot and in cars have reported seeing the girl standing in the window of the turret in front. On the upper floors, many have seen a woman dressed all in black wandering along, running her fingers along the books. No one knows who this ghostly woman could be.
