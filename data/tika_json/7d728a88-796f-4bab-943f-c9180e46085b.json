When Indian children who were living there became sick with TB they were locked in the cool damp basement because it was thought that this would help them. It didn't. State employees report the ghosts of children all over the basement and first two floors of the house. The attic is less haunted but people feel presences and alarm clocks get tipped over. The forms of children can be seen walking around often at night inside.
