Many persons fishing there have seen a canoe paddled by a Native American pull up to the bank, then disappear. There have been reports of singing and voices near the river. The Army Corp of Engineers now fences off the area. Late at night workers and fisherman report an old man with a yellow dog walking the banks of the North Levee Rd. People report seeing the man because of an angry expression on his face. Sometimes a dog can be heard wailing from the site.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.01", "moon_upper_transit": "09:32  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "state_abbrev": "WA", "city_latitude": "47.2528768", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:37  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "WA", "state_x": "Washington", "median drinks per binge": "5.3", "binge drinking (%)": "15.4", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "87.2", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:14  DT", "latitude_x": "47.2507286", "under 21 death percentage": "1.82", "usgs_region": "Northwest", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "city_sunrise": "5:07 am", "taxpayer cost": "5805000000.0", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "moonset": "17:19  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "3184.0", "witness_count": "2", "latitude_y": "47.0379", "longitude": "-122.4108725", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "30.0", "sunset": "21:11  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.5", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "5.671077504725898", "city_longitude": "-122.4442906", "quarter": "1", "chronic death percentage": "64.6", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
