She used to live on adjacent Wood Street and had a boyfriend at the house. The brothers in the house used to complain that she always left her hair dryer plugged in the upstairs bathroom. In 1992, two brothers went into the bathroom after hearing a hair dryer turn on. They went to investigate but found nothing on the counter or plugged in. Mysteriously the room was steamy and the words \"Hitch A Ride\" were faintly etched on the mirror.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.0", "longitude_y": "-76.4922", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "4216975.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:08  DT", "city_latitude": "39.6581424", "state_y": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:08  DT", "median drinks per binge": "5.3", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "7.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "79.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "7.5", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "38.9784", "latitude_x": "39.6526599", "under 21 death percentage": "3.22", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "usgs_region": "", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Maryland", "taxpayer cost": "4965000000.0", "hp_day": "1988/07/03", "moonset": "00:35  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "2", "state_abbrev": "MD", "longitude": "-78.92760419999999", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "binge drinking (%)": "14.5", "sunset": "20:35  DT", "robbery": "", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-78.92835699999999", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "46.6", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
