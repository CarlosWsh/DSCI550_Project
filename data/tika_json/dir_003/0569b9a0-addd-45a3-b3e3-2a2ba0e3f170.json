She got drunk, and she wanted to go home. Her boyfriend offered to take her home, but she refused. She said that she would walk home. When crossing the highway, she was hit by a car and she died. One boy and his friend were biking down the old bike trail that is now shut down. The first time around, they were riding in tall grass, and they caught a glimpse of a pale girl walking in the grass right in front of them. One of the boys swerved to miss her. They turned and looked back, and saw nothing. They went around the trail once more and looked where they almost hit the girl. They didn't see anything. Where she was walking in the tall grass, no evidence was left - no footprints or broken grass. Stumped, the boys kept biking and then suddenly came to a stop. What they saw in frontof them was that same girl in the torn shirt wearing shorts sitting on a high tree branch. The branch was a flimsy branch and it's obvious it wouldn't be able to support more than about maybe 10 pounds. Yet stumped again, the boys took another trip around the trail and saw nothing.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.94", "longitude_y": "-95.6752", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:25  DT", "city_latitude": "38.8791783", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Kansas", "state_abbrev": "KS", "binge drinking (%)": "16.7", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.9", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "39.0473", "latitude_x": "", "under 21 death percentage": "3.14", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:25  DT", "city_sunrise": "5:40 am", "taxpayer cost": "2076000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "17:00  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "2", "median drinks per binge": "5.6", "longitude": "", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:52  DT", "robbery": "", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-99.3267702", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "59.6", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
