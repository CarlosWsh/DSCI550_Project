To this day, numerous witnesses have heard screaming coming from the gully, and their headlights have turned off when the car is parked on the bridge at night. Others have said to feel \"cold\" spells on warm nights. - October 2004 correction: There were several established Indian campsites located in the hills and upon bright nights of a full moon in October and November (the Hunter's Moon, if you stand quietly on the road, you will feel their spirits pass you and see glowing orbs in the hollows of the hills.
