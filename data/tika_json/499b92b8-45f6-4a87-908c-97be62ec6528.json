There is also a basement that has an old hand-crank electric chair in it. A few yards away is the female jail that seems to have an upper story but no way to get up there. The female jail is the most haunted due to beatings and killings of the prisoners.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.58", "moon_upper_transit": "09:21  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.945179584120983", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:36  DT", "city_latitude": "32.5251516", "state_y": "LA", "sunrise": "06:03  DT", "state_abbrev": "LA", "binge drinking (%)": "18.1", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "79.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "30.4571", "latitude_x": "", "under 21 death percentage": "4.13", "usgs_region": "Southeast", "sun_upper_transit": "13:07  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Louisiana", "taxpayer cost": "3801000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:22  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "2278.0", "witness_count": "1", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "longitude": "", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "5.0", "sunset": "20:10  DT", "median binges monthly": "2.0", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-93.7501789", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "48.9", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
