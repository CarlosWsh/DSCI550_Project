Many areas are haunted. In mid-May '00, one guard was dozing in his patrol car at night when he heard a knock on the window. He opened his eyes to see 2 men, one on either side of the car, pointing at him & laughing. He could see right thru them. This guard (an ex-marine) never believed in ghosts & taunted the others who did. The other guards wouldn't go to that area at night & warned him that it was haunted, but he didn't believe them then.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.08", "longitude_y": "-73.7562", "aggravated assault": "", "state_abbrev": "NY", "resident_population": "16782304.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "03:42  ST", "city_latitude": "40.7282239", "state_y": "NY", "sunrise": "04:17  ST", "median drinks per binge": "5.4", "number_of_tribes": "2.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "7.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.4", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "13.2", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "11:57  ST", "latitude_x": "40.7585569", "resident_population_density": "356.1", "usgs_region": "Northeast", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "city_sunrise": "4:57 am", "state_x": "New York", "taxpayer cost": "16330000000.0", "hp_day": "1960/05/01", "moonset": "17:19  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "2", "latitude_y": "42.6526", "longitude": "-73.7654367", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "17.6", "sunset": "19:36  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.3780718336483932", "city_longitude": "-73.7948516", "quarter": "2", "chronic death percentage": "63.3", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
