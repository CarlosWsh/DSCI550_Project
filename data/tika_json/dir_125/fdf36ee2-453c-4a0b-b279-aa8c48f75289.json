There never was an insane asylum and there are two sites. The abandoned structure is the control center and the lower site is the magazine/launch area where the missiles were stored and launched.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.75", "moon_upper_transit": "09:04  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.5671077504725899", "city_latitude": "41.5726229", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:42  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "CT", "state_x": "Connecticut", "state_abbrev": "CT", "number_of_tribes": "3.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "84.9", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "68.2", "latitude_x": "41.6386993", "resident_population_density": "", "usgs_region": "Northwest", "sun_upper_transit": "12:53  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "3029000000.0", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "moonset": "16:30  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "", "median drinks per binge": "5.2", "longitude": "-72.54478449999999", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "time_of_day": "Morning", "binge drinking (%)": "18.7", "sunset": "20:29  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-72.6408139", "personal theft/larceny": "", "chronic death percentage": "55.2", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
