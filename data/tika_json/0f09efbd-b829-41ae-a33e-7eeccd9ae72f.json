There is a long narrow road going back into the woods that is very difficult to get down. You then come upon a church, out in the middle of nowhere, there is a very small (one room ) and white. Located directly across the road is a cemetery with graves dating back to the 18th century. Although there have been accounts of graves freshly dug. The story goes that back in the 80's a boy was found mutilated. Most say that it was a cult killing. But the church was shut down and the newspaper clipping of this horrible event still exists. The church has been re-opened but there are still accounts of hearing faint piano music coming from inside the church late at night.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.86", "longitude_y": "-84.388", "aggravated assault": "", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:58  ST", "city_latitude": "34.2514526", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Georgia", "state_abbrev": "GA", "binge drinking (%)": "15.1", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.6", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "69.3", "latitude_x": "34.2367621", "under 21 death percentage": "3.67", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:39  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "6931000000.0", "hp_day": "1776/12/31", "moonset": "23:54  ST", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "2", "median drinks per binge": "5.3", "longitude": "-84.4907621", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "19:51  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_longitude": "-84.4802606", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "55.3", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
