The church was burnt down 10-20 years ago because of a priest haunting it. It is off of Townline Rd. There have been many ghost sightings there including odd noises, shadows, footsteps following you, a bell ringing, and other various noises. - March 2005 Update/Correction: the church was burned down by the lake geneva fire department because it was condemned. they used the church as training for the fire department. there were stories of devil worship going on in the church basement and the stories are TRUE. A group investigated it several times before they put up the no trespassing sign. There are sounds of a bell while you are there but the bell seems to be coming from a house in the distance. While there they report seeing mist around a tombstone that disappeared when they approached. Also repoted, a shadow that moved across the tombstones and vanished. and there are strange smells it is believed they are coming from the swamp that is behind the cemetery.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.19", "longitude_y": "-89.4012", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "1.890359168241966", "city_latitude": "42.5916836", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:43  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "WI", "sun_upper_transit": "13:00  DT", "state_abbrev": "WI", "binge drinking (%)": "25.8", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "43.0731", "latitude_x": "42.5886283", "under 21 death percentage": "2.3", "usgs_region": "Midwest", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Wisconsin", "taxpayer cost": "4453000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:44  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "7", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "longitude": "-88.359332", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "10.0", "sunset": "20:41  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.7", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-88.4334301", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "63.2", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
