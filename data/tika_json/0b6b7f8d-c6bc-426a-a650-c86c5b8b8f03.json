We use to party down there all the time. It was nicknamed Goat Man's Bridge. There was a man who was man from head to waist and goat from waist down. People say if it's really quite you can hear him. And if you park your car in the middle of the bridge it will not start. They say you can hear children screaming. A friend of mine said he was out there alone one night and he saw someone standing by a tree. He threw his pocketknife at the man and it went right though him and stuck in the tree. I have also heard that a few miles back behind the bridge is a church. Not just any church but, a satanic church. A lot of strange things happened out at that bridge. If you're from Burk and want to go out there ask anyone from Burk they can tell you right where it is.
