There are two doors, both locked with deadbolts. One becomes unlocked repeatedly - when there is only one person with a key - and this person has not been near the door. The elevator sometimes goes up and down without anyone in it. There is a presence of not being alone - not malevolent. This house used to house a family with 10 children in the early 1900's. The ghost is lovingly referred to as \"Vanessa\" after the mother of these children.
