The grave is a pile of rocks about ten feet from the road (on the right side if you are coming from Sterling) that can be found from a cleared path. It can easily be visited without being bothered. Sightings of a 17 foot tall black flash have been seen, about 2 feet above ground, crossing the road in front of car headlights, and then chasing the car, in addition to everything already said. - An Indian girl was killed by English soldiers in the section of the forest. Ever since, cries attributed to her have been heard there. The ghost of a little girl named Maude has been appearing for 100 years on Hell Hollow Road near her gravesite. It is located along Hells Hallow Road. When riding in a car and her name is uttered by her gravesite, the car is supposed to either stall or crash. Observers have also seen orbs. Also, a man running through the woods at the same speed of the car was seen by a passenger in a vehicle.
