But she got caught with marijuana and thought she was going to lose her spot as a cheerleader. So she got a gun and committed suicide. There was a sighting in about 1998 or 1999. Hayden's softball team had a tournament, and one of the teams stayed in the Jr. High gym. They said that at about 12:00AM, they saw a young girl dressed in a cheerleader uniform, doing a routine. As soon she was done, she disappeared. There is also another story of a man who lost his life on the football field. While he was running the ball, he got tackled, broke his neck, and died instantly. It is said that on some nights, you will see a football player running the ball. He\u2019ll fall and then disappear from the football field.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.27", "year": "1988", "longitude_y": "-112.074", "aggravated assault": "", "city_latitude": "32.9875659", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:50  DT", "resident_population": "2718215.0", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Arizona", "state_abbrev": "AZ", "binge drinking (%)": "16.7", "resident_population_density_rank": "42.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "84.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "53.5", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "68.3", "latitude_x": "32.9906994", "under 21 death percentage": "2.75", "median binges monthly": "1.5", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:30  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "5946000000.0", "hp_day": "1988/12/31", "moonset": "00:56  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "longitude": "-110.7713387", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:41  DT", "robbery": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_longitude": "-110.7709387", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "59.2", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
