In the mid 70's there was a devil-worshiping cult that used it to sacrifice animals. It has one remaining building all others were torn down due to the decrements. This building is definitely haunted; witnesses have heard noises from the upper floor and seen lights near the fountain at night. It has tunnels that lead from Northwestern part of town to the Southeastern side of town, which ends up at the airport; they have all been caved in. It has been a place for teenagers to go and party. Different people have experienced something in what they call the \"Alter Room\". It is a shadowy figure that lurks just inside the doorway. There is also a cemetery just to the north of the building, graves disturbed and a large cross has been cut down. Town legend says that the teenagers that cut it down in the 70's all died that year. The houses around the area are also reported to have paranormal activities. The Holy Cross in recent days has become a dangerous place to be. Murders have been committed there in the last few years. A gang has killed a peer as a sacrifice and a lover\u2019s quarrel was the demise of a man in a drainpipe. The place has always been that of graffiti artists writing their names or the names of their favorite bands. Now gang names and signs are all over it marking it as territory. Sheriffs patrol it often now and run people off who are in there and possibly arrest them for trespassing.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.74", "moon_upper_transit": "09:22  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:18  DT", "city_latitude": "32.2686981", "state_y": "", "state_x": "New Mexico", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.6", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "35.6822", "latitude_x": "", "under 21 death percentage": "2.59", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:06  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "2233000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:35  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "6", "state_abbrev": "NM", "longitude": "", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "15.6", "sunset": "20:23  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-107.7586404", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "61.2", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
