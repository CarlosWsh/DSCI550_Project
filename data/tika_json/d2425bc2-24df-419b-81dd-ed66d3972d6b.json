Light never touches the door, no matter what lights are on, and even during the day, light barely makes it into the window to hit the door. There has been other sightings on the floor - a figure walking across a resident\u2019s room near the door \u2013 they were the only one in the room, and the door was closed. All i could see was the pants, they seemed to be a gray polyester. Other rooms have seen figures in hard hats and blue suits. When they rolled over to get up and talk to them, the figure was gone, and when they checked the door, they realized it was still locked - the doors at that time would unlock if you closed them while they were locked. They have also seen a white figure in a corner - non-descript, just standing there.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.15", "longitude_y": "-100.3538", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "1.5122873345935728", "state_abbrev": "SD", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:20  DT", "city_latitude": "42.87110879999999", "state_y": "SD", "state_x": "South Dakota", "median drinks per binge": "5.7", "number_of_tribes": "8.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "82.5", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:43  DT", "latitude_x": "42.874457", "resident_population_density": "", "usgs_region": "Midwest", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "5:30 am", "taxpayer cost": "598200000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "17:35  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "4", "latitude_y": "44.3668", "longitude": "-97.410359", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "binge drinking (%)": "22.3", "sunset": "21:29  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.7", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-97.3972813", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "65.9", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
