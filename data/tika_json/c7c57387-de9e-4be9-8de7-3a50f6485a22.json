A former worker of the Sheriff's Department that worked there for 4 years which is in the courthouse on the second floor. In the jail area, there is a large Plexiglas wall that is used for the visitation area. The door that leads between them will make a loud bass noise when it is closed because it flexes this large sheet of Plexiglas. There are also two cameras overlooking this area. While working at night, they and many others have heard this door closing and making the bass noise, but you can plainly see on the cameras that no-one is there, and the door is not moving. Also within the same building, the third floor was where the operating rooms were. The floor used to have the old style ceramic tile that had very large cracks. It has been carpeted for many years as the third floor is now where the district court and district attorney's offices are now. While working in the 911 dispatch center on the second floor, you can sometimes here what sounds like the wheels of a hospital gurney being rolled across ceramic tile, making a \"click, click\" sound. It will at times sound like it is being pushed slow, and at others like they are sprinting down the hallway. Some of the deputies have checked the floor when they heard this noise. The lights are all off and no one has been found, plus the fact that the only tile on that floor is the newer style vinyl tile that is very smooth. The police department is on the first floor where the emergency room used to be, so they probably have there own stories to tell.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.36", "location": "Cherokee County Courthouse", "longitude_y": "-97.5164", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "16.257088846880908", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:45  DT", "city_latitude": "35.91537", "state_y": "OK", "state_x": "Oklahoma", "median drinks per binge": "5.6", "number_of_tribes": "86.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "85.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "35.4676", "latitude_x": "35.9135622", "under 21 death percentage": "2.76", "usgs_region": "Southwest", "sun_upper_transit": "13:32  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "3081000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:59  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "", "state_abbrev": "OK", "longitude": "-94.9734524", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "13.6", "sunset": "20:49  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.5", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-94.969956", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "58.7", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
