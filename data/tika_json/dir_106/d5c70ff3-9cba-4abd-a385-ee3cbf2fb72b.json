There have been sightings and sounds throughout the building, but the worst area seems to be the auditorium. When it was being built, a worker fell from one of the catwalks and was killed when he landed on the chairs below. There have also been a few other deaths reported in the area. An area under the stage where props and sets are kept, called \"Siberia\", is a hot spot as well. Lights turn on and off by themselves, things move around, and you can hear voices when no one else is down there.
