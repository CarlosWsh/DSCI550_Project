A mile or so up this road you will come to narrow one lane trestle bridge. The road goes under this. Legend has it that at one time there was a farm house built near the tracks. Late one night a fire broke out in the barn. While the father ran to the barn to try to get the horses out, his wife and young son went to the tracks to wave down one of the many trains that would use that right of way. They were too close to the tracks however and both were struck by the train as it went past. The father was killed in the barn. Now if you go out there late at night, you can sometimes communicate with the Father. He will not allow you to talk to his wife or son; as if he was protecting them . There are other people living in the area now, and a large streetlight has been placed there by the people who own the neighboring land. If you stay there to long, they will call the police. However if you make your visit short enough they will usually leave you to it. This place has also been described as a good place to go to contact other spirits. The Father can be asked to help in this matter. He will not allow antagonistic spirits to talk however; once again to protect his family.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.84", "location": "Ghost Trestle", "moon_upper_transit": "09:53  DT", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "2.2684310018903595", "city_latitude": "41.8975471", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:25  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "MI", "state_x": "Michigan", "median drinks per binge": "5.6", "binge drinking (%)": "19.8", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "84.44", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:40  DT", "latitude_x": "41.904538", "resident_population_density": "", "usgs_region": "Midwest", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "8162000000.0", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "moonset": "17:23  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "2", "state_abbrev": "MI", "longitude": "-84.03565619999999", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "12.0", "sunset": "21:20  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-84.03716589999999", "personal theft/larceny": "", "chronic death percentage": "59.6", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
