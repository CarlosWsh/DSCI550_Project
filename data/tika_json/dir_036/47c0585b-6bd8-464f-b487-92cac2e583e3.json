Many neighborhood residents use this as and uncomfortable but fast shortcut to the other side of the freeway and neighborhood children often play in them. Many people including have heard the voices of two people whispering in the tunnels late in the evening when there is none around. They sound like a male and female and coincidently just before those tunnels were built a young couple were flying down Olive on motorcycles and hit the pile of construction debris that was there at the time. They crashed early morning and were not discovered until around 6 am.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.01", "moon_upper_transit": "08:12  DT", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "3.213610586011342", "resident_population": "1201833.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:01  DT", "city_latitude": "36.1699412", "state_y": "NV", "state_x": "Nevada", "state_abbrev": "NV", "number_of_tribes": "17.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "47.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.6", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "50.1", "simple assault": "595.0", "sun_upper_transit": "13:01  DT", "latitude_x": "36.1587768", "under 21 death percentage": "2.39", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "usgs_region": "Pacific", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "2296000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "14:57  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "2", "location": "Sandhill and Charleston", "longitude": "-115.09359", "time_of_day": "Morning", "binge drinking (%)": "16.0", "sunset": "20:29  DT", "robbery": "106.0", "hp_day": "1995/07/31", "city_longitude": "-115.1398296", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "61.5", "rape/sexual assault": "33.0"}
