Shortly after the house's construction, Agnes, died of a stroke in her room at the mansion. Dorr Felt re-married but his new wife hated spending time at the house, most likely because Agnes was still there in spirit. The house has been a home for boys, then for nuns, and a state police post. After many, many years, the house is finally getting restored and ghost tours are giving through it to help raise money. Doors have opened and closed in Agnes's room, voices are heard, and activity shows up in pictures like orbs and mists. Many believe that Agnes and Dorr still reside in the house. The ballroom is said to be the most haunted room in the house.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.84", "moon_upper_transit": "17:32  ST", "aggravated assault": "", "city_latitude": "42.6550248", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:25  ST", "resident_population": "3668412.0", "state_y": "MI", "sunrise": "05:00  ST", "state_abbrev": "MI", "binge drinking (%)": "19.8", "resident_population_density_rank": "14.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "84.44", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "30.5", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:40  ST", "latitude_x": "42.6970535", "under 21 death percentage": "2.57", "usgs_region": "Midwest", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Michigan", "taxpayer cost": "8162000000.0", "hp_day": "1920/03/01", "moonset": "23:47  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "4", "latitude_y": "42.7335", "longitude": "-86.1940284", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "12.0", "sunset": "20:20  ST", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "2.2684310018903595", "city_longitude": "-86.2019825", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "59.6", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
