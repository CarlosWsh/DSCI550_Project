The Lodge is a 3story log/wood building and contains a general store, a restaurant, a game room, and guest/employee rooms. It stands at 10,000ft. elevation in a valley\u00a0of the San Jaun Mountain Range in Southern Colorado. There is much history at the lodge and in the Platoro area in general. Platoro was founded in the early 1880's to provide housing, food and even a post office for local gold/silver miners. One of the\u00a0ghosts that haunt the area/lodge is believed to be 'Little Eva'. Eva was a 16yr. old prostitute\u00a0that was shot by the wife of a local miner. Her grave is an unmarked concrete slab that's in a field about 150yrds from the lodge.\u00ad - (private property)\u00ad - Another 'Spirit' is believed to be Henry, the ghost of a man that passed\u00a0away(1950's) inside the main lodge after suffering a heart attack while hunting.

Doors opening/shutting, even locking on there own. Numerous cold spots that are almost always there. The sound of furniture being dragged across upper floors when no one's around.
