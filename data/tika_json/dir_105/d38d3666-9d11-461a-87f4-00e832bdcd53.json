There have been several occurrences of a baby shrieking, a man walking and sometimes dashing down the hallway, a little boy who appears in the master bathroom, and a young woman with a baby. The man stops about halfway through the hallway and looks into the master bedroom, then continues until he approaches the kitchen and stops and turns around toward the hallway again, where he disappears. The baby shrieks from the living room. The young woman carries her baby and speaks to it. Once, the door to one of the back bedrooms slammed shut and a woman's voice was heard arguing loudly with someone else. The door was then unable to opened for a few minutes.. The young woman will also tell the tenants to go back to bed when she sees them wandering the house at night. The little boy will appear in the master bathroom in front of the door when it is closed and he will stare at the occupier of the bathroom. When addressed, he disappears. Voices can be heard through the night on a regular basis and occasionally the man will dash through the hallway, bumping into things that aren't there.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.36", "longitude_y": "-97.5164", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "16.257088846880908", "city_latitude": "35.1467405", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:45  DT", "resident_population": "2328284.0", "state_y": "OK", "state_x": "Oklahoma", "state_abbrev": "OK", "number_of_tribes": "86.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "37.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "85.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "4.3", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "35.4676", "latitude_x": "", "under 21 death percentage": "2.76", "median binges monthly": "1.5", "usgs_region": "Southwest", "sun_upper_transit": "13:32  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "3081000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "17:21  DT", "visual_evidence": "False", "witness_count": "8", "median drinks per binge": "5.6", "longitude": "", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "13.6", "sunset": "20:49  DT", "robbery": "", "hp_day": "1968/07/31", "city_longitude": "-97.0089117", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "58.7", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
