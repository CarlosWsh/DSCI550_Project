This area is also swampland and there was a partial platoon that got stranded and drowned in the quicksand on the banks of the swampland\u00a0after they were forced marched into it by a Drill Instructor. I believe this accounts for the constant manifestations in the old barracks (Recruit Living quarters) there have been several Ghost sightings, moaning sounds, and bathroom stall doors flying open or slamming close and faucets that turn on and toilets that flush by themselves. This is something that is common knowledge to most Parris Island Marines but is not widely known to the public.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.88", "moon_upper_transit": "22:25  ST", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.1890359168241966", "resident_population": "1515400.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:44  ST", "city_latitude": "32.3513924", "state_y": "SC", "state_x": "South Carolina", "median drinks per binge": "5.7", "number_of_tribes": "1.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "18.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "82.7", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "13.1", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "70.8", "latitude_x": "32.3513924", "resident_population_density": "50.4", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "usgs_region": "Southeast", "sun_upper_transit": "12:26  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "3983000000.0", "hp_day": "1918/03/17", "moonset": "02:45  ST", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "2586.0", "witness_count": "7", "state_abbrev": "SC", "longitude": "-80.6891655", "curphase": "Waxing Gibbous", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "binge drinking (%)": "16.3", "sunset": "19:38  ST", "robbery": "", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-80.6891655", "personal theft/larceny": "", "chronic death percentage": "54.5", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
