Haunted by at least one entity of unknown origin. The building director of eight years knows of no death in the building during his time here. The activity centers on the third floor, particularly the south side of the building. Phenomena range from rummaging sounds coming from bathrooms, elevator doors opening and closing when people walk by, smoke-like apparitions, reddish stains appearing on walls and voices that have been heard by nearly every staff member. There is a globe style lamp in the hallway that leads to the bathroom in every unit of the hotel. One night in July of 1999 every single one fell to the floor while the hotel was between conferences and vacant, it took two days to put them back up.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.89", "longitude_y": "-104.9903", "aggravated assault": "123.0", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "resident_population": "3294394.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:59  DT", "city_latitude": "40.0149856", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Colorado", "state_abbrev": "CO", "binge drinking (%)": "19.8", "resident_population_density_rank": "40.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "14.0", "simple assault": "347.0", "male death percentage": "67.7", "latitude_x": "40.0128877", "under 21 death percentage": "2.78", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:02  DT", "city_sunrise": "5:03 am", "taxpayer cost": "5057000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "01:36  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "4", "latitude_y": "39.7392", "longitude": "-105.27186", "curphase": "Waxing Gibbous", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:31  DT", "robbery": "55.0", "hp_day": "1999/07/31", "city_longitude": "-105.2705456", "quarter": "3", "chronic death percentage": "61.3", "rape/sexual assault": "31.0"}
