In the late 1820's a diseased midget was outcast for his disability. On his journey from the port city of Georgetown, he was to meet the love of his short life outside of the historic city. When he arrived for his rendezvous he witnessed his mistress hanging in a tree. She was being punished for having performed supposed witchlike experiments in an effort to heighten her lovers stature. It is said that the \"Midget Man\" found his lover struggling for her last breaths, but was unable to reach her to help her escape death's grip. After this experience, \"Midget Man\" lost his sanity and prowled the field until the day of his own death. Pass Georgetown going down HWY 51 turn left on a dark road called Amos. Follow the road. On the left somewhere go into the spooky field. You will see a big scary tree with bark on it. The decaying bark symbolizes his stresses decaying skin, which rotted there over time. Watch for the stumps on the ground that are said to have sprouted from \"Midget Man's\" tears. You know it is the right tree because there is a patch of dark grass in the woods behind it. Walk around the tree three times and reach up to rescue the lady, a vague image of \"Midget Man\" can be seen yonder dancing and cheering due to the release of his lovers soul.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.88", "longitude_y": "-81.0348", "state_abbrev": "SC", "city_latitude": "33.376834", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:43  ST", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "SC", "state_x": "South Carolina", "median drinks per binge": "5.7", "number_of_tribes": "1.0", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "82.7", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "70.8", "latitude_x": "", "resident_population_density": "", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "usgs_region": "Southeast", "sun_upper_transit": "12:25  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "3983000000.0", "hp_day": "1827/12/31", "moonset": "17:24  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "", "location": "\"The Midget Man\"", "longitude": "", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "16.3", "sunset": "19:38  ST", "robbery": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.1890359168241966", "city_longitude": "-79.2944964", "personal theft/larceny": "", "chronic death percentage": "54.5", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
