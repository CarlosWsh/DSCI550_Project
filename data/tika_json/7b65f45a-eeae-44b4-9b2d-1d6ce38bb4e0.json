The University Police Department used to be housed in the building, but recently vacated for a new building. Officers and other workers in the building used to hear and see things. Footsteps are often heard upstairs and shadowy figures have been seen. Unexplained noises have also been heard. One officer saw a shadowy figure walk from one room to another. When she checked the room, she found no one. There was no way for anyone to get in or out of the area without passing her. She also heard a static noise coming from an intercom one night at 4am. No one else was in the building and the intercom system was no longer in use. The building currently houses offices for another one of the University's departments and is locked after 5pm.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.85", "moon_upper_transit": "09:28  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.945179584120983", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:29  DT", "city_latitude": "35.7795897", "state_y": "NC", "state_x": "North Carolina", "state_abbrev": "NC", "binge drinking (%)": "15.8", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "82.7", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:16  DT", "latitude_x": "35.7846633", "under 21 death percentage": "3.08", "usgs_region": "Southeast", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "city_sunrise": "5:19 am", "taxpayer cost": "7034000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:40  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "4452.0", "witness_count": "1", "latitude_y": "35.7804", "longitude": "-78.6820946", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "5.0", "sunset": "20:34  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-78.6381787", "quarter": "1", "chronic death percentage": "56.3", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
