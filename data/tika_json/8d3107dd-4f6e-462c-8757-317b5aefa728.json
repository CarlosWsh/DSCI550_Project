Around the time that John P. Adams began to build the tower house both his wife May and toddler son Marion passed away. Until 1943 Mr. Adams continued to live in his wonderful house with tower rising over the structure. He owned several lots which extended well toward the town square and a store which is still located at 210 Spring St. on the historic town square. Since 1963 a few brave individuals have admitted to hearing May weep or show fear during a storm. John is often seen strolling through the house from the men's parlor to the front room which houses a Civil War exhibit. Marion is seen upstairs in the boys' room where he and brother John Jr. would watch for kids to come down the way. Marion is seen at times toddling over to the window. He is a blonde haired boy clothed in a wonderful soft light. There are no bad spirits here. May did show great sadness the day a 1870's period garment was place on display in their master bedroom which is now the main lodging room for the current inn. Several media sources have already noted this haunting including radio and newspapers in Tennessee. The inn is owned by GhostLabs Research Society's Dan and Carol Gist. Carol conducts ghost tours each day or house tours according to visitors requests. Information about the inn can be accessed on the - Ghostlabs.com website.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.04", "longitude_y": "-86.7816", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_latitude": "35.4817431", "begin_civil_twilight": "03:59  ST", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Tennessee", "state_abbrev": "TN", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "83.8", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "36.1627", "latitude_x": "35.500225", "under 21 death percentage": "2.95", "median binges monthly": "1.7", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "11:49  ST", "city_sunrise": "4:47 am", "taxpayer cost": "4684000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "12:29  ST", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "3359.0", "witness_count": "5", "location": "Historic Tower House Inn", "longitude": "-86.084544", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "binge drinking (%)": "15.7", "sunset": "19:07  ST", "robbery": "", "hp_day": "1870/01/01", "city_longitude": "-86.0885993", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "55.3", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
