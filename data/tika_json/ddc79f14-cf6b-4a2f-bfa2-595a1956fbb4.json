The Academy was purchased by Catholic nuns in 1877 and became a girl's school until it closed in 1971. This beautiful Academy is now a Bed and Breakfast and an antique store. Pictures taken inside the school and on the grounds surrounding it show orbs, vortexes and mists. These pictures appear on the Academy's web site.
