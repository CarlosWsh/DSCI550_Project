The story says that if you are to walk behind the church there is a trail behind it leading into the woods. You may hear things running through the woods to meet you at the end of the trail. The objects will make odd noises like a panther. It's a really high-pitched scream that will send chills up your spine. Residents from miles away can hear the screams from all around the church. - December 2003 update; you can't go to Hickory Springs at night, because there is a no trespassing sign and cameras everywhere. If you trespass, you will be arrested. You can go there during the day though the groundskeeper will shoot Trespassers.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.86", "longitude_y": "-84.388", "state_abbrev": "GA", "resident_population": "8186453.0", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:58  DT", "city_latitude": "31.4504629", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Georgia", "median drinks per binge": "5.3", "binge drinking (%)": "15.1", "resident_population_density_rank": "20.0", "adult_35plus death percentage": "81.6", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "26.4", "simple assault": "324.0", "male death percentage": "69.3", "latitude_x": "31.527105", "under 21 death percentage": "3.67", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:39  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "6931000000.0", "hp_day": "2003/12/20", "moonset": "13:41  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "3953.0", "witness_count": "", "location": "Hickory Springs", "longitude": "-83.608464", "time_of_day": "Night", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:51  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_longitude": "-83.5084973", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "55.3", "rape/sexual assault": "21.0", "robbery": "54.0"}
