After theaters closed, he and another security guard had to lock all the doors to the mall. One security guard went up to the parking level to check the parking lot and lock the doors that lead to this level. He saw another security guard up there, his friend, and not the one he'd just left. The guy was far away, so he called to his friend, but the guy didn't answer. He called again, this next time his friend turned and looked and him then walked away, disappearing around a corner. The security guard went to follow him and found the man gone. This was about one or two a.m. He later asked the other security guard if he had seen their co-worker, the other man said no. The next day, the security guard found out that the man he saw had died at about the same time he'd seen him.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.13", "longitude_y": "-157.8584", "aggravated assault": "125.0", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "state_abbrev": "HI", "city_latitude": "21.3069444", "begin_civil_twilight": "06:25  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Hawaii", "median drinks per binge": "5.7", "binge drinking (%)": "20.9", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "87.8", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "328.0", "male death percentage": "72.6", "latitude_x": "21.2705629", "resident_population_density": "", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:33  DT", "city_sunrise": "5:37 am", "taxpayer cost": "937400000.0", "hp_day": "2023/01/01", "moonset": "23:28  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "1", "latitude_y": "21.307", "longitude": "-157.7762165", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "20:16  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "country": "United States", "city_longitude": "-157.8583333", "curphase": "Waxing Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "61.2", "rape/sexual assault": "30.0", "robbery": "53.0"}
