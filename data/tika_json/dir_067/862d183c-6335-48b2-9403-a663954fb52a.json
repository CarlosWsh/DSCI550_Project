If you called on her she was supposed to appear in the trees in white. Supposedly you could hear her crying at night. -  December 2005 Update/Additional Information: Another story is that she lost her mind when her husband died, and kids teased her and called her a witch. The story is in fact a legend in the area, but was based around the Macy/Decatur area. Supposedly there was a trapper married to a Sioux woman, and they had a cabin along the Missouri river around an area called Blackbird Bend. The husband came home from a hunting trip earlier than expected and surprised her and her lover.
