THERE IS A ROAD THAT IS CALLED OLD ST. LOUIS RD. THE STORY IS THAT IN THE 1800'S IT WAS USED TO GET TO ST. LOUIS FROM FARMINGTON. IN BETWEEN 1800 AND 1954 THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DIED. NOW THEY ALL HAUNT THIS ROAD. THE DIRECTIONS ARE TO FOLLOW OLD CHARTER CHURCH RD. UNTIL YOU COME TO A GRAVEL ROAD THAT LEADS INTO THE WOODS AND KEEP GOING AT A SPEED OF ABOUT 15 OR 20 MPH. KEEP GOING FOR ABOUT 2 OR 3 MINUTES AND STOP THE CAR. TURN EVERYTHING OFF AND SIT IN COMPLETE SILENCE WITH YOUR WINDOWS DOWN HALF WAY, ALL THE WAY IF YOUR REALLY BRAVE. MANY THINGS START TO HAPPEN LIKE SOUNDS OF PEOPLE TALKING IN THE WOODS AND PEOPLE WALKING AROUND. THE MOST COMMON ONE IS A GIRL STARTS SCREAMING VERY FAINTLY AND IT GETS LOUDER AND LOUDER AND THEN STOPS. AFTER A FEW SECONDS GOES BY THEN A MAN WITH BLOOD ALL OVER HIM COMES OUT OF THE WOODS AND STARTS A CONVERSATION WITH YOU. ANOTHER COMMON THING THAT HAPPENS IS WHEN YOU LEAVE YOU SEE A FLIPPED CAR IN THE ROAD WITH A MAN THAT ASKS YOU TO HELP HIM FLIP HIS CAR BACK OVER. BEFORE OR AFTER YOU SEE THIS YOU START FEELING HANDS AND FINGERS START TOUCHING ALL OVER YOU LEGS AND BODY.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.47", "year": "1800", "longitude_y": "-92.1735", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_latitude": "38.1394978", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:12  ST", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "", "sunrise": "04:44  ST", "state_abbrev": "MO", "binge drinking (%)": "18.9", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "80.2", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "latitude_y": "38.5767", "latitude_x": "38.6746192", "under 21 death percentage": "3.72", "median binges monthly": "1.8", "usgs_region": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:10  ST", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "Missouri", "taxpayer cost": "4604000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "19:36  ST", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "2", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "longitude": "-90.2107527", "time_of_day": "Unknown", "number_of_tribes": "", "sunset": "19:36  ST", "robbery": "", "hp_day": "1800/01/01", "city_longitude": "-90.5551258", "curphase": "New Moon", "chronic death percentage": "52.5", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
