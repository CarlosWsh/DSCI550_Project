Change has been heard dropped in soda machines but no one is there, scratching sounds of basement floor. - February 2004 Update: is now just used for the office of the register, housing has been moved down to South West Hall. Which did once have a creepy incident involving a ouija board where a wall began to crack open. Also for Potter it was in room 8 on the bottom floor that the girl hung herself -- though that is debated some believe she was murdered. - January 2006 Correction/ Update: A student that attended school with the girl has cleared a few things up on this particular haunting. She was a Very quiet but very nice girl. Though she didn\u2019t leave a note, she had taken her own life. They report her name was Teresa nicknamed Tye-Dye.
