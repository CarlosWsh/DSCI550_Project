Residents find doors, which were confirmed, to be closed and locked at night when they wake in the morning. Mud has mysteriously appeared and then disappeared in beds. Pillows have been thrown across rooms in the middle of the night, after being yanked out from underneath sleeping residents. Cries and whimpering have been heard shortly after the pillow incidents. It is rumored that the dorm is built on the site of an old hotel where a little boy was murdered.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.29", "moon_upper_transit": "09:26  ST", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "16.824196597353495", "state_abbrev": "CA", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:10  ST", "city_latitude": "34.1705609", "state_y": "CA", "sunrise": "04:41  ST", "median drinks per binge": "5.5", "binge drinking (%)": "16.6", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "86.1", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "12:07  ST", "latitude_x": "34.2250167", "under 21 death percentage": "2.49", "median binges monthly": "1.6", "usgs_region": "Pacific", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "California", "taxpayer cost": "35011000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:46  ST", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "15443.0", "witness_count": "1", "location": "California Lutheran University", "longitude": "-118.8788537", "time_of_day": "Morning", "number_of_tribes": "89.0", "sunset": "19:33  ST", "robbery": "", "hp_day": "1873/06/15", "city_longitude": "-118.8375937", "quarter": "2", "chronic death percentage": "64.4", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
