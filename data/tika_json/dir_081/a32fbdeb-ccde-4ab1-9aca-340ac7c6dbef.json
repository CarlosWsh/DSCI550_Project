The history behind this church is not really known, but something definitely is unusual about the site. It is a very old unused church and there is a cemetery behind the church with a large iron gate. At the cemetery entrance witnesses heard singing and saw faint lights on in the church. It was very cold all of a sudden(on a July evening) and the air was very heavy. They ran and got back into the car and as soon as they pulled away from the church the lights in the church suddenly went off.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.88", "longitude_y": "-81.0348", "aggravated assault": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "0.1890359168241966", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "05:44  DT", "city_latitude": "33.9204354", "state_y": "SC", "sunrise": "06:13  DT", "median drinks per binge": "5.7", "binge drinking (%)": "16.3", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "82.7", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "70.8", "latitude_x": "34.0595352", "under 21 death percentage": "3.21", "usgs_region": "Southeast", "sun_upper_transit": "13:26  DT", "city_sunrise": "", "state_x": "South Carolina", "taxpayer cost": "3983000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:47  DT", "annual deaths (excessive alcohol)": "2586.0", "witness_count": "2", "state_abbrev": "SC", "longitude": "-80.3000698", "time_of_day": "Evening", "number_of_tribes": "1.0", "sunset": "20:39  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "city_longitude": "-80.3414693", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "54.5", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
