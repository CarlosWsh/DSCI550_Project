It shut down a few years ago and is now a nature preserve. My husband went hunting for deer there last fall and came home scared with the intention of never going back. He said he heard voices, drums, what seemed to be something pounding on wood, and screams. I have spent a lot of time there, day and night. Over the past year I have collected video and pictures of orbs, sounds, and apparitions. The spirit of an old woman has been seen in the parking area along the tree line. She seems to be welcoming you in. The area to the north of the gate has the most activity. The area to the back of the main road is quite active. These have all been seen during the day as well as at night.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "2.51", "moon_upper_transit": "09:14  DT", "aggravated assault": "", "resident_population": "", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:58  DT", "city_latitude": "39.97531439999999", "state_y": "", "state_x": "Illinois", "median drinks per binge": "5.7", "number_of_tribes": "", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "82.0", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "sun_upper_transit": "13:00  DT", "latitude_x": "39.986522", "under 21 death percentage": "3.48", "usgs_region": "", "quarter": "1", "city_sunrise": "", "taxpayer cost": "9716000000.0", "country": "United States", "moonset": "16:36  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "4", "state_abbrev": "IL", "longitude": "-87.54219909999999", "time_of_day": "Night", "binge drinking (%)": "20.5", "sunset": "20:30  DT", "median binges monthly": "1.9", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "", "city_longitude": "-87.6358546", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "57.4", "rape/sexual assault": "", "robbery": ""}
