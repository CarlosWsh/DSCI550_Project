He continues walking and hears the laughing again. The janitors employers found his body torched as if it had been set on fire. Another story was also about a janitor, supposedly himself or someone had hung him from the pull rope of the old bell in the tower, Stories of every night at midnight the bell would ring, this was before the timer was installed, when the bell was rang at recess by the sixth graders.
