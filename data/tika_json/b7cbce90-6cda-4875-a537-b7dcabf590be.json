Jon was between the ages 13-15. He was walking by the area of the school that was being built at around 7:00pm Pacific Time. A man in dark clothes grabbed him and stabbed him 10 times. 4 times in the face, 2 in the arm, and 4 in the chest area. A person in a car drove by and saw a body on the ground. It was Jon. They never caught the man who killed him. [Fact] At school kids and some adults see a dark figure that is blurred out in corners and darker areas. Girls and women reported seeing figures in a bathroom by the cafeteria. The figure roams the halls most of the time between 12:00 in the afternoon till about 5:00pm.", "cost per drink (in 2022 us$)": "3.01", "moon_upper_transit": "09:32  DT", "state_abbrev": "WA", "city_latitude": "47.6587802", "begin_civil_twilight": "04:37  DT", "resident_population": "", "state_y": "WA", "state_x": "Washington", "median drinks per binge": "5.3", "binge drinking (%)": "15.4", "resident_population_density_rank": "", "adult_35plus death percentage": "87.2", "percent_change_in_resident_population": "", "simple assault": "", "male death percentage": "66.0", "latitude_x": "47.6376018", "resident_population_density": "", "median binges monthly": "1.5", "usgs_region": "Northwest", "sun_upper_transit": "13:14  DT", "city_sunrise": "4:47 am", "taxpayer cost": "5805000000.0", "hp_day": "2025/01/01", "moonset": "17:19  DT", "visual_evidence": "True", "witness_count": "6", "location": "Bowdish Middle School", "longitude": "-117.2520123", "latitude_y": "47.0379", "time_of_day": "Afternoon", "number_of_tribes": "30.0", "sunset": "21:11  DT", "robbery": "", "percentage_of_total_tribes": "5.671077504725898", "city_longitude": "-117.4260465", "curphase": "Waning Crescent", "chronic death percentage": "64.6", "rape/sexual assault": ""}
